The analogy might seem like a stretch, but things like convection, thermohaline mixing and rotational mixing do occur in stars and need to be included in the models. I also work on 3D simulations of convection, for which I do use the Pencil code, a high order MPI code for MHD.

He enjoys working at the interface between theory and observations, particularly on topics related to the global and dynamical properties of stars, and their changes with stellar age. He has a special interest in understanding how stars rotate, and why they do so at the measured rates. Major results of his work include the identification of patterns in the distribution of stellar rotation periods, an explanation of these in terms of stellar magnetism, and gyrochronology, a new way of deriving the ages of individual stars."}]},"field_link":{"und":[{"url":"http:\/\/ftp.lowell.edu\/rsch\/programs.php?p=barnes","title":null,"attributes":[]}]},"field_speaker":{"und":[{"value":"Sydney Barnes","format":null,"safe_value":"Sydney Barnes"}]},"field_place":{"und":[{"value":"Lowell Observatory","format":null,"safe_value":"Lowell Observatory"}]},"field_profile":{"und":[{"fid":"1737","title":null,"data":null}]},"field_surname":{"und":[{"value":"Barnes"}]},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"cid":"0","last_comment_timestamp":"1358284894","last_comment_name":null,"last_comment_uid":"1356","comment_count":"0","name":"jeastman","picture":"1406","data":"a:2:{s:19:\u0022ldap_authentication\u0022;a:1:{s:4:\u0022init\u0022;a:3:{s:3:\u0022sid\u0022;s:6:\u0022ad2sba\u0022;s:2:\u0022dn\u0022;s:46:\u0022CN=Jason Eastman,OU=Astro,OU=SBA,DC=LCO,DC=GTN\u0022;s:4:\u0022mail\u0022;s:18:\u0022jeastman@lcogt.net\u0022;}}s:7:\u0022contact\u0022;i:1;}","path":{"pid":"19687","source":"node\/5043","alias":"seminar\/barnes","language":"en"},"menu":null,"node_export_drupal_version":"7","#node_export_object":"1"},{"vid":"12688","uid":"1356","title":"Planets Around Red Dwarfs","log":"","status":"1","comment":"1","promote":"1","sticky":"0","nid":"5044","type":"seminar","language":"en","created":"1358284984","changed":"1358358916","tnid":"0","translate":"0","revision_timestamp":"1358358916","revision_uid":"1356","body":{"und":[{"value":"\u003Cp\u003EM-type dwarfs are the Galaxy\u0026rsquo;s most numerous denizens, and for many reasons they represent our best hope of finding Earth-like planets outside the Solar System.
