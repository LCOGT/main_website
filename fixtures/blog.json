Weather permitting, this enables continuous coverage of celestial objects of interest - mainly time-variable objects.

In June 2008 we were able to see the first blanks at the Hextek workshop. We expect about one set of mirror blanks each month from now on. The mirrors are initially fused flat, with cylindrical glass tubes separating the top and bottom glass plates. Hextek provide mirror blanks which are as stiff as solid blanks of the same size, but much lighter - each primary weighs 160 lbs, each secondary weighs 12 lbs.

The first set of mirror blanks will go to <strong>LZOS</strong> in Russia in September, followed by shipments every 6 months. The first set of finished and coated mirrors is expected in early 2009.   \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Telescope Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWe plan to have the first telescope ready for mechanical testing at Santa Barbara by the end of 2008, and have the first prototype telescope working on the sky in Santa Barbara with an imager (not the final version) early in 2009. There will be a period of testing the telescope system: mechanics, drives, optics, control system, camera and scheduling, then we plan to deploy the first fully functioning 1-m telescope in a roll-off enclosure, with control system, 4K CCD and associated equipment, by the end of 2009. Observation requests that have been approved by the Time Allocation Committee will be entered onto a network queue: automatic scheduling software will decide when each observation will take place, and on which telescope.  \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Image Quality<br />\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n[[{\"attributes\": {\"alt\": \"1.0m_spotdiag_s.jpg\", \"style\": \"float: left; height: 209px; width: 229px; \", \"class\": \"media-image large imagecache\", \"rel\": \"imagecache\", \"typeof\": \"foaf:Image\"}, \"view_mode\": \"media_large\", \"type\": \"media\", \"fid\": \"203\"}]]The 1-m telescopes are designed to work remotely and reliably, and provide accurate photometry.   The figure shows the optical quality calculated on-axis, at an edge and corner of the CCD. Each box is scaled to represent a single CCD pixel (0.4 arcsec). Image quality degrades a little at the autoguider field which is 95-mm off axis. The box there shows a typical binned autoguider pixel of 0.8 arcsec.  A medium resolution spectrograph (one for each cluster) will be fed from a 3-arcsec diameter fiber for each telescope from this off-axis area.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe main requirement is that neither the telescope (optics, tracking, local thermal environment) nor detector system (autoguiders, CCD, filter wheel) should noticeably degrade the intrinsic site image quality.  Our telescopes will be deployed at existing and well-serviced observatories, where we typically expect image quality of 0.8-1.3 arcsec, so the intrinsic image quality will always exceed the optical quality of the telescope.   \r\n</p>\r\n<h3> Secondary Mirror Support  </h3>\r\n<p>\r\n[[{\"attributes\": {\"alt\": \"Secondary mirror support\", \"style\": \"float: right; height: 200px; width: 200px; \", \"class\": \"media-image large imagecache\", \"rel\": \"imagecache\", \"typeof\": \"foaf:Image\"}, \"view_mode\": \"media_large\", \"type\": \"media\", \"fid\": \"199\"}]]The mirrors are made of borosilicate glass (quartz), and do expand with temperature. The secondary support is an Invar hub, with Nickel content adjusted to best match the expansion coefficient of the glass. Prior to polishing, it is epoxied to the back surface of the secondary. A cylinder protrudes through the central hole to provide an air passage for clean dry air to pass over the reflecting surface in humid conditions, and to support an alignment fixture. The central hole is preserved and can be used to minimize thermal background radiation for a possible future infrared camera.    \r\n</p>\r\n<h3> Primary Mirror Support<br />\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n[[{\"attributes\": {\"alt\": \"Primary mirror support\", \"style\": \"float: left; height: 200px; width: 200px; \", \"class\": \"media-image large imagecache\", \"rel\": \"imagecache\", \"typeof\": \"foaf:Image\"}, \"view_mode\": \"media_large\", \"type\": \"media\", \"fid\": \"200\"}]]Finite element analysis showed that a central hub support could work for the primary mirror also, but the required hub would be large and heavy. Therefore the primary is supported on a traditional 18-point whiffle tree, with an 18-point radial support system operating on the lower plate of the mirror. The cut-away figure shows the primary mirror in its cell, which also forms the declination axis for the telescope. The baffle is supported from the mirror cell and does not touch the mirror.  The optical prescription includes a doublet lens corrector for good wide-field images, which can be seen supported in the central hole of the primary.    \r\n</p>\r\n",

Our telescopes will be deployed at existing and well-serviced observatories, where we typically expect image quality of 0.8-1.3 arcsec, so the intrinsic image quality will always exceed the optical quality of the telescope.   \n</p>\n<h3> Secondary Mirror Support  </h3>\n<p>\n<span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/egomez/T1-001-0102-000.jpg?itok=xKBfYK7o\" alt=\"Secondary mirror support\" title=\"\" /></span>The mirrors are made of borosilicate glass (quartz), and do expand with temperature. The secondary support is an Invar hub, with Nickel content adjusted to best match the expansion coefficient of the glass. Prior to polishing, it is epoxied to the back surface of the secondary. A cylinder protrudes through the central hole to provide an air passage for clean dry air to pass over the reflecting surface in humid conditions, and to support an alignment fixture. The central hole is preserved and can be used to minimize thermal background radiation for a possible future infrared camera.    \n</p>\n<h3> Primary Mirror Support<br />\n</h3>\n<p>\n<span id=\"styles-4-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"4\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/egomez/T1-001-0400-000.jpg?itok=vNK_QOFw\" alt=\"Primary mirror support\" title=\"\" /></span>Finite element analysis showed that a central hub support could work for the primary mirror also, but the required hub would be large and heavy. Therefore the primary is supported on a traditional 18-point whiffle tree, with an 18-point radial support system operating on the lower plate of the mirror. The cut-away figure shows the primary mirror in its cell, which also forms the declination axis for the telescope. The baffle is supported from the mirror cell and does not touch the mirror.  The optical prescription includes a doublet lens corrector for good wide-field images, which can be seen supported in the central hole of the primary.    \n</p>\n",

In a couple of months we&#39;ll move the single Aqawan to the corner of the parking lot where the huge blue dumpster currently is. The new Dual Aqawan will be prototyped at SBA in the second half of this year, and the first three production Dual Aqawans will be deployed to our site in Chile in the first quarter of 2010.</p><h4><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> Telescope Prototype</h4><p>In the shop we have the beginnings of our <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> telescope&nbsp;mounts. One of these will be tweaked, cabled, and tested in the shop during the next 2 months, and within a couple of months after that the optical tube assembly (the actual telescope part) will be mated to the mount. One of the mounts currently has a temporary fixture of 2 smaller 20&quot; telescopes mounted on it. This mimics the weight and &quot;feel&quot; of the real <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> telescope, allowing the engineers to test the mechanical properties of the mount before the actual telescope is ready. Our first set of finished optics for this telescopes will be arriving from LZOS (our Russian supplier) very soon, just in time to be installed in the first new telescope.</p><h4><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> Enclosure Prototype</h4><p>In parallel to the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> telescope project, we are designing and building a domed enclosure to house the telescopes. The dome hemisphere itself will be an of-the-shelf product that we are purchasing, and identical to the one used at Sedgwick. The circular wall to support the dome is being custom designed and prototyped here at SBA by LCOGT. The beginnings of the prototype wall can be seen today rising out of the floor in the warehouse. The walls are all metal, and will be prefabbed &amp; modularized into 6 transportable sections. These sections will already be equipped with electrical conduit and ventilation fans in the walls, and be pre-drilled for anchor bolts. The sections will be shipped in a container and reassembled on site, and then the dome will be assembled and craned onto the walls. This prefabbed modular design will remove decision making and variability from the international contractors, allowing us to obtain a consistently good product of known specs.</p><p>In the next couple of months the completed <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> enclosure prototype will be broken down into its 6 modules, removed from the warehouse, and reassembled on its new foundation in the parking lot. The dome will be assembled and placed on the enclosure walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>Site Services Building (SSB)</h4><p>This is the centralized IT building that will be placed at each site. Power, communications, and other computer control will be distributed from this building to all the domes, Aqawans, and miscellaneous outside equipment at each site. The shell of the SSB will be a used metal shipping container, 8&#39; x 20&#39;. The container will be modified and outfitted to our specs, including doors, HVAC, electrical, etc., at a commercial facility and then shipped to our SBA warehouse. Here we will add IT racks, servers, electrical distribution panels, etc., etc. When complete and tested, it will be shipped to site, probably near the end of 2009. The first one will arrive at SBA for outfitting around mid-October of this year. The image shows a typical example of one of these modified sea crates.</p><h4>Observatory Site Preparation</h4><p>In parallel to all the above work, we are currently in the design process of laying out the Chile site in preparation for site construction, which will begin in mid-September (their spring season). Each site will need a daunting amount of infrastructure development, including earth work, concrete foundations for 3 observatories and 3 Dual Aqawans, trenching, and a mile (literally) of conduit for utility placements.

However, these two galaxies are in a region of sky where there happens to be a lot of dust from our own Galaxy in front.  This means that we are also looking through the debris in our own Galaxy, and as you can see from the &quot;wispy&quot; image above, there are places where space is filled with lots of dusty filaments.  The material in the north may actually be in our own Galaxy and not associated with M81 so this needs further checking to be sure. <br /><br /><strong>Galaxies galore</strong><br /><br />We can also use Herschel to look deep into space and see distant galaxies which were around when the Universe was very young, when the Universe was about a third to a tenth of its present day age.    In this image we are literally detecting thousands of galaxies.  One of the really surprising things we've learnt with Herschel, is that we see so many sources like this in the background of our images, far more than we expected.  The colours in this image give an idea how distant the galaxies are.  </p><p><strong>Complex chemistry </strong></p><p>Herschel has not just been busy taking images, it has also used its numerous spectrographs to search for molecules and atoms in galaxies, stars and comets.  One example is the spectra of the famous galaxy Arp220 shown here, which is the result of two giant galaxies merging together.   Arp 220 is around 250 million light years away and is undergoing a renewed (and active) period of star formation as a result of the merger which has comrpessed and heated the gas.   Arp 220 is an important &quot;laboratory&quot; for astronomers to test theories on what the first few generations of galaxies would look like.  What we see in this spectrum are emission and absorption features of water and carbon monoxide.  Herschel is the first instrument to allow us to look at spectra in the submillimetre wavebands and the wealth of information it tells us is outstanding.  Not only can we detect water (seen for the first time in emission here), but we can figure out what its temperature and density is.  The latest spectra of the massive giant star VY Majoris shows evidence for hot steam, which is cooling the star in the same way we use steam to cool nuclear reactors in power stations! </p><p><strong>Dusty evidence of galaxy-scale interactions</strong><br /><br />At Cardiff,we have been working hard this week on some data we have of a giantelliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster, the nearest group of galaxiesto us.  Ellipticals, so called due to their elliptical-like appearancein visible light, are often described as &quot;red and dead&quot; galaxies,where stars are no longer forming and all the dust has been used up.  The elliptical galaxies we see today, are thought to be the descendantsof the massively dusty, active star forming galaxies seen in the veryearly Universe; these galaxies are forming stars thousands of timesfaster than our own and are likely harbouring an active galacticnucleus at their centre.  Astronomers are not really sure how thesemassive systems form, particularly whether or not they are formed bymerging galaxies together from collisions.  An important question toaddress is whether or not environment affects the formation andevolution of these systems.  Other questions we want to ask is &quot;areellipticals really devoid of dust?&quot; and, &quot;what can we learn about theirhistory using any dusty features we can see?&quot;.    Well it turns out alot!  <br /><br />Take a look at the optical image of the galaxies in theVirgo cluster.  The brightest galaxy in this image is the giantelliptical M86 (bottom right).  We can also see the spiral galaxyNGC4438 on the left, with a smaller galaxy nearby.    In the Herschelsubmillimetre image however, the elliptical galaxy is now the faintestgalaxy (this is because it must have used all its dust up in formingstars).  We also see something quite unusual, the dust is offset fromthe centre of the galaxy and appears to be distributed in a verydifferent way to the stars.  If we now compare the dust to hot hydrogengas (which shows gas being pulled out of the galaxy due to theinteraction with the galaxy in the top right) we see a pretty goodmatch.  The dust appears to be following the ionised hydrogen trailingout of M86 and is being pulled towards the galaxy in the top left. This is really strong evidence that environment significantly affectsdust and metals in galaxies, the data points to more than a millionSun's worth of dust being stripped from this source. </p><p>So that's a small introduction into some of the results from Herschel, but there are many more to come, and plenty of work left to do!  Keep up with the latest news <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=16\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>",

BJ is particularly interested in finding out the mass of the stars in these clusters.</p><!--break--><p><span style=\"line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #222222\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">The images attached (click on them to zoom) are standard RGB composites produced in Adobe Photoshop. Red is composed of 6x300 second exposures in the SDSS-I band filter. Green is 6x300 second exposures in the SDSS-R filter and Blue is 1x300 second exposure in the SDSS-G band filter. There is also a luminosity layer on top to help bring out some of the fainter detail that is an ultra-deep SDSS-I band image composed of approximately 16x300 second exposures (depending on the cluster). Total exposure time of about 2.5 hours.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #222222\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">BJ and <a href=\"/user/nbaliber\">Nairn Baliber</a> are looking for photometric variability of the very young stars in these young clusters. At early ages, these stars have very strong magnetic fields which produce large star spots on the surface of the stars. As the star rotates, these star spots will move across our line of sight and can be seen as a slight decrease in brightness. This puts better constraints on their models of star and planet formation. These particular images will help to estimate the masses of the stars being studied. </span></p><p>The spectral camera has a chip twice as large as any other camera on our 2m telescopes, at 16 Megapixels (4096x4096 pixels square). Despite being a bigger chip it has a faster readout time than the Merope camera which is also mounted on the 2m's, at 6 seconds (compared to Merope's 20+ seconds).

BJ is particularly interested in finding out the mass of the stars in these clusters.</p><p>The images attached (click on them to zoom) are standard RGB composites produced in Adobe Photoshop. Red is composed of 6x300 second exposures in the SDSS-I band filter. Green is 6x300 second exposures in the SDSS-R filter and Blue is 1x300 second exposure in the SDSS-G band filter. There is also a luminosity layer on top to help bring out some of the fainter detail that is an ultra-deep SDSS-I band image composed of approximately 16x300 second exposures (depending on the cluster). Total exposure time of about 2.5 hours.</p><p>BJ and <a href=\"/user/nbaliber\">Nairn Baliber</a> are looking for photometric variability of the very young stars in these young clusters. At early ages, these stars have very strong magnetic fields which produce large star spots on the surface of the stars. As the star rotates, these star spots will move across our line of sight and can be seen as a slight decrease in brightness. This puts better constraints on their models of star and planet formation. These particular images will help to estimate the masses of the stars being studied. </p><p>The spectral camera has a chip twice as large as any other camera on our 2m telescopes, at 16 Megapixels (4096x4096 pixels square). Despite being a bigger chip it has a faster readout time than the Merope camera which is also mounted on the 2m's, at 6 seconds (compared to Merope's 20+ seconds). The field of view is significantly larger than previous cameras at around 10 x 10 arcminutes. Since we now have 4 times as many pixels the quality of the images is much higher.</p><p>These images were taken with the autoguider enabled which is now much more routine. This means we can use much longer exposure times and observe fainter objects.  We have also warped the secondary mirror with about 40 lbs/sq-in of force at the edges to make M2 have a mild potato chip surface to compensate for a slight optical distortion called astigmatism present on the primary mirror. Both of these measures have made stars in the images smaller and rounder.</p><p>If you own  a copy of Adobe Photoshop and would like to make your own color images from our <a href=\"/search/archive\">public data archive</a>, using our <a href=\"/education/article/how-make-color-astronomical-images-photoshop\">making color images activity</a> .</p><p>Many thanks to  BJ Fulton for the information on the observations and making the color images. </p>",

The parameters of this gas giant, which has features in common with the majority of exoplanets discovered so far, represents a valuable standard model when it comes to identifying new Jovian-type bodies with moderate temperatures.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis European-led discovery has involved 60 astronomers worldwide, including LCOGT and <a href=\"http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">UCSB</a> scientists Drs.<a href=\"/user/tlister\"> Tim Lister</a>, <a href=\"/user/rstreet\">Rachel Street</a>, <a href=\"/user/mhidas\">Marton Hidas,</a> and <a href=\"/user/ashporer\">Avi Shporer</a>.<br />\r\n“CoRoT-9b is the first transiting exoplanet that is definitely similar to a planet in our Solar System.” says Dr. Marton Hidas. “What's special about this planet is that compared to other transiting planets it is a temperate planet,” explains Dr. Rachel Street, “with great potential for future studies concerning its physical characteristics and atmosphere.”<br />\r\nAnalysis of the planet's transits has provided more information on CoRoT-9b than for other exoplanets of the same type. More than 400 exoplanets have been discovered so far, 70 of them through the transit method. A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star's light. This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet's mass, diameter, density and temperature to be deduced. The fact that CoRoT-9b takes 95 Earth days to orbit its star demonstrates the usefulness of Space observations in finding planets with long orbital periods, a very difficult task when observing from the ground. Indeed, its period is about 10 times longer than that of any planet previously discovered by the transit method.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe CoRoT satellite identified the planet after 150 days of continuous observations during the Summer of 2008. Due to the nature of CoRoT measurements, any detection requires verification using ground-based telescopes. This was done by the <a href=\"/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">Faulkes Telescope North</a>  (FTN), located on Mt. <a href=\"/site/haleakala\">Haleakala</a>  on the Hawaiian island of Maui. FTN is a 2 meter telescope, part of the LCOGT network. “Since a transit occurs only once every 95 days, FTN was at the right place at the right time to observe the transit on September 2009, thereby confirming the CoRoT detection”, says Dr. Tim Lister, who carried out the FTN observations, in collaboration with other telescopes across the globe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe astronomical community has been looking during the last decade for a transiting extra-solar planet with a &quot;pure, isolated&quot; history of evolution, without the contamination and interference of its parent star.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The new planet keeps a relatively large distance from its central star, similar to<br />\r\nthe orbit of Mercury around the Sun.” says Dr. Avi Shporer, “permitting the application of<br />\r\nplanetary evolution models without corrections, as have been needed with other transiting<br />\r\nplanets, orbiting their parent stars in close-in orbits, with a typical orbital period of under a<br />\r\nweek.” The planet is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, but it may contain up to 20 Earth<br />\r\nmasses of heavier elements including rock and water under high pressure. It is thus very similar<br />\r\nto the Solar System's giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe international team of astronomers participating in the discovery notes that while temperate<br />\r\ngas giants are so far the largest known group of planets, CoRoT-9b is the first transiting planet<br />\r\nof this kind.

This is the first public mention of the new planets and the research will be described in upcoming scientific journal articles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Planet evolution theorists now have to explain how so many planets came to be orbiting like this,” said Tim Lister, a project scientist at LCOGT.

By adding these nine new “transiting” planets, the number of known transiting planets has grown from 71 to 80. A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star's light. This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet's mass, diameter, density, and temperature to be deduced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the initial detection of the new exoplanets by the <a href=\"http://www.superwasp.org/\">Wide Angle Search for Planets</a> (WASP), the team of astronomers combined data from LCOGT's <a href=\"/network/2m\">2.0-meter Faulkes Telescopes</a>  in <a href=\"/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">Hawaii </a> and <a href=\"/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-south\">Australia</a>  with follow-up from other telescopes to confirm the discoveries and characterize the planets.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe planets are revolving around nearby stars within 1,000 light years of our galaxy. Their stars are located in the constellations Pegasus, Virgo, Pisces, and Andromeda, in the northern hemisphere, and Eridanus, Hydra, Cetus, and Phoenix, in the southern hemisphere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nine planets are called “Hot Jupiters.” The planets are orbiting other stars that have masses similar to that of Jupiter, but they orbit their parent stars much more closely than any of the planets in our solar system. In the 15 years since the first Hot Jupiters were discovered, their origin has been a puzzle. Because they are both large and close, they are easier to detect from their gravitational effect on their stars and more likely to transit the disk of the star. Most of the first exoplanets that were discovered were of this type.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe cores of giant planets are thought to form from a mix of rock and ice particles found only in the cold outer reaches of planetary systems. Hot Jupiters, therefore, must form far from their star and subsequently migrate inwards over the course of a few million years. Many astronomers believed this could happen due to gravitational interactions with the disk of dust from which they formed, and which might also subsequently form Earth-like rocky planets. However, these new results suggest this may not be the whole story because it does not explain how planets end up orbiting contrary to the orbit of the disk.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe best alternative migration theory suggests that the proximity of Hot Jupiters to their stars is not due to interactions with the dust disk at all, but to a slower evolution involving a gravitational tug-of-war with more distant planetary or stellar companions over hundreds of millions of years, according to the research team. Bounced onto a tilted and elongated orbit, a wandering gas giant would suffer tidal friction every time it swung close to the star, eventually becoming parked in a near circular, but randomly tilted orbit close to the star. “In this scenario, smaller planets in orbits similar to Earth's are unlikely to survive,” said Rachel Street.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLCOGT's flexible approach to scheduling means the network provides responsive and highly efficient follow-up for large-scale surveys such as WASP.

He wondered what it should be called. We all wondered then I said, “Why not call it Pluto”. And the whole thing stemmed from that.”</p><p>As a tribute to Venetia's extraordinary contribution and to its young discoverer, the American Clyde Tombaugh, <a href=\"http://www.spacerenaissance.org/EDU/\"><span style=\"color: #000000\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Space Renaissance Education Chapter</span></a>, in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.fatherfilms.com/films/namingpluto/\"><span style=\"color: #000000\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Father Films</span></a>, announce the launch of Naming X, a global online competition, to find the next influential student or school group with the creative and scientific talent to suggest a suitable name for a minor planet and a reason why.</p><p>The Committee for Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) of the International Astronomical Union, the body responsible for the naming of minor planets and comets, is supporting this educational initiative and will consider the winning names for the naming of minor planets.</p><p>‘We have a first class judging panel and with the support of CSBN we are very excited to see the results of an inspired global think tank. We may even repeat history say organisers Thilina Heenatigala &amp; Ginita Jimenez.</p><p>Judges for Naming X include Canadian astronomer &amp; comet discoverer, David Levy, Professor Ian Morison of Gresham University, who holds the oldest chair of Astronomy in the world also held by Christopher Wren and Marc W. Buie, collaborator on the New Horizons Mission to Pluto &amp; staff scientist at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), one of the oldest and largest independent, nonprofit, applied research and development (R&amp;D) organizations in the United States.

He wondered what it should be called. We all wondered then I said, “Why not call it Pluto”. And the whole thing stemmed from that.”</p><p>As a tribute to Venetia's extraordinary contribution and to its young discoverer, the American Clyde Tombaugh, <a href=\"http://www.spacerenaissance.org/EDU/\">Space Renaissance Education Chapter</a>, in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.fatherfilms.com/films/namingpluto/\">Father Films</a>, announce the launch of Naming X, a global online competition, to find the next influential student or school group with the creative and scientific talent to suggest a suitable name for a minor planet and a reason why.</p><p>The Committee for Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) of the International Astronomical Union, the body responsible for the naming of minor planets and comets, is supporting this educational initiative and will consider the winning names for the naming of minor planets.</p><p>‘We have a first class judging panel and with the support of CSBN we are very excited to see the results of an inspired global think tank. We may even repeat history' say organisers Thilina Heenatigala &amp; Ginita Jimenez.</p><p>Judges for Naming X include Canadian astronomer &amp; comet discoverer, David Levy, Professor Ian Morison of Gresham University, who holds the oldest chair of Astronomy in the world also held by Christopher Wren and Marc W. Buie, collaborator on the New Horizons Mission to Pluto &amp; staff scientist at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), one of the oldest and largest independent, nonprofit, applied research and development (R&amp;D) organizations in the United States.

In particular comparing the colors to those of the asteroid, it looks to brighten far too much as you move from the red part of the spectrum into the near infrared part.  Asteroids tend to darken or at most be uniform in brightness across this spectral region (r' filter to Z filter). Furthermore, the object was almost 4 times fainter than predicted if it had been a typical asteroid on 25 May.  Preliminary checks of its orbit have not as yet revealed any candidate spacecraft during the past 30 years or so although it looks to have made a close-pass in 1975.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther work has shown that the spectral characteristics observed using the FTN are consistent with UV-aged titanium dioxide paint.

Bash Visitor's Center </span>this Saturday, July 17, 2010. The recommissioning of the telescope was completed by Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT) engineers and scientists, and funded by LCOGT founders Wayne Rosing and Dorothy Largay, Mike and Shirley Marcario, Mike I. and Dee Jones, Bill and Becky Wren and anonymous donors. The event marks the long-anticipated return of the science-grade telescope to a facility that receives over 60,000 visitors a year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The George B. Wren II Supernovae Search Telescope (SNST) was originally dedicated in May of 1995 in memory of George B. Wren (1917-1993) who was the founder of Pipeline Inspection Company and made numerous advances in pipeline leak detection systems in his lifetime. George Wren built a scale model of the SNST shortly before his death. His son, astronomer William Wren, was looking for supernovae using 30&quot; and 36&quot; telescopes at the time. He found 1992H, 1994Y, 1997cq, and 1997ea using these scopes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">William Wren chose the unique <span style=\"line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Fundyscope design for the new telescope because it </span>increased the search rate for visual identification of phenomena such as supernovae.

The McDonald telescope, the largest known implementation of a Fundyscope on the planet, deploys the mirrors and eyepiece on separate piers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The telescope is being rededicated as the Wren-Marcario Accessible Telescope to honor both Wren and Michael Marcario (1954-1998). Marcario, through his company High Lonesome Optics, designed innovative and high-grade optical systems for telescopes and spectrographs. The scope incorporates a rigid mount, low diffraction optics, and a fixed viewing position. It contains two 18-inch, f/8 primary mirrors and a 24-inch diameter control mirror.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wayne Rosing and several LCOGT engineers have been on-site completing final commissioning and upgrades for the telescope in the hours leading up to the dedication.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The dedication ceremony, to be attended by Rosing, LCOGTpersonnel, and officials from the University of Texas, Austin and their Astronomy Program, commences in daylight on the afternoon of the 17<sup>th</sup>. Festivities will spill into the night as the telescope is put to use in the dark skies above the Davis Mountains of Texas.</p><h4>Human-Engineering Design</h4><p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDonald Observatory is the University of Texas at Austin's Astronomy Department's facility. Situated in the darkest county in Texas, McDonald sits in the Davis Mountains 440 miles west of the University campus and 200 miles southeast of Juarez, Mexico. The telescopes on site range from the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly telescope to a 0.8m telescope and support a wide spectrum of astronomical studies. The WMAT fulfills the role of a publicly-available, eyepiece telescope on the popular site.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">One impetus for the redesign and rededication of this telescope has been the demand for telescope access for mobility impaired or completely wheelchair bound individuals. The Observatory Visitor's Center receives 60,000 visitors a year, many for the Observatory's popular Star Parties. The redesigned telescope and viewing area ensures that nearly everyone who visits will be able to observe astronomical targets. </p><a name=\"WMAT at sunset\" title=\"WMAT at sunset\"></a><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The revised design includes two 18” (0.46m) primary mirrors aligned north-south with a steering flat mirror centered between them to allow easier, quicker access to the entire sky. When the flat steering mirror is pointed towards the south with the observer to the north, the observer can see the southern sky quadrant. The northern quadrant becomes visible by rotating the flat mirror and eyepiece assembly 180º. This movable flat mirror allows the telescope to slew quickly to numerous targets in rapid succession while the eyepiece remains fixed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">After an extensive tear-down, redesign, and rebuild conducted at LCOGT's Goleta, California headquarters, LCOGT engineers began on-site mechanical assembly of the WMAT in late June of 2009.

I checked the status of the telescope and the rain sensor had begun closing the dome.</p><p>After talking with the audience for a few minutes it became apparent the the telescope would not open before our hour of time was up.  I explained the situation to the audience, and offered that if they wanted to stay I could show them a selection of images taken with the Faulkes Telescope North by students here on Maui, and they could ask me questions.   A few people filtered out, but most stayed.  Question after question and image after image.  Finally the library had to tell people, “One last question....\"</p><p>In spite of the rain at the summit those who attended had a great time.  “We also had several people come in and want to know when the next astronomy program was scheduled!” said Latimer.  After packing away my equipment, and talking with the librarians for a few minutes I headed out to my car.  Several people came up to me in the parking lot to say “thanks”.  Most them turned around got in their cars and drove off.  They had been waiting to say thanks and shake my hand.  That's the kind of community we have here – the spirit of Aloha.</p><p> </p>",

          "value": "Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope's (LCOGT) Faulkes Telescope North (FTN) was featured in <em>The Pfluke Times</em> of Kihei, Hawai'i in two articles in a recent Sunday edition. Stating that “It is a very cool telescope,” Anthony Pfluke, the 10-year-old editor and journalist for the paper, described the telescope, the LCOGT outreach program and director, and included in the piece stunning photographs taken by himself and other participants in a homeschool session provided through LCOGT and the University of Hawai'i's Institute for Astronomy.\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nFaulkes Telescope North is situated on the island of Mauion Haleakala (Holly-ah-kah-lah), but Pfluke did not need to ascend the mountain to use the telescope. Dr. J. D. Armstrong, Maui Technology Education and Outreach Specialist for the Institute for Astronomy (a position 50% funded by LCOGT), brought the mountain to Pfluke and his classmates.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nFTN is one of three telescopes that comprise the <a href=\"http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/RoboNet/welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">Robonetglobal network</a> of large (2-meter) robotic telescopes. In existence since 2003, the Robonet project's principal scientific aims are to detect cool extra-solar planets by optimized robotic monitoring of Galactic microlens events, and to determine the originand nature of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) by providing rapid response and optimized robotic monitoring.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nThe three Robonet telescopes are the FTN located in Maui, the Faulkes Telescope South (FTS) in eastern Australia at Siding Springs, and the ‘Liverpool' telescope on the Canary Island of La Palma. LCOGT owns and operates the two Faulkes telescopes.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Expanding and Successful Education Program</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nWhile LCOGT is invested in the Robonet science aims, the company is also committed to providing educational opportunities for schools and learners of all ages. With Education Director Dr. Edward Gomez based in Cardiff, UK, and staff members in the UK and at LCOGT headquarters in Goleta, California, the program has developed <a href=\"/education\" target=\"_blank\">tools and lessons</a> for learning, using, and participating in astrophysics projects and observations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nDr. Armstrong, located in Hawai'i, brings the experience into homes and classrooms across the island, making FTN a truly local resource. Stating that Dr. Armstrong “is an important guy,” Pfluke described the methodology used to make the observation time available. “When people take pictures on the Faulkes, they usually take them just from their laptop… they just click and the telescope will move over the object you want to image.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n[[{\"attributes\": {\"alt\": \"The Pfluke Times, Sept 5, 2010, Page 4\", \"style\": \"float: left; height: 450px; width: 296px; \", \"class\": \"media-image medium_large asset_lightbox\", \"rel\": \"asset_lightbox\", \"typeof\": \"foaf:Image\"}, \"view_mode\": \"media_large\", \"type\": \"media\", \"fid\": \"803\"}]][[{\"attributes\": {\"alt\": \"The Pfluke Times, Sept 5, 2010, Page 8\", \"style\": \"float: none; height: 450px; width: 300px; \", \"class\": \"media-image medium_large asset_lightbox\", \"rel\": \"asset_lightbox\", \"typeof\": \"foaf:Image\"}, \"view_mode\": \"media_large\", \"type\": \"media\", \"fid\": \"804\"}]] \r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nThe two Faulkes telescopes are in different hemispheres, allowing users to view the entire scope of astronomical objects that can be seen from Earth. The large size of the telescopes (2-meter primary mirrors) enables students and scientists to observe very faint objects. The proximity of the two telescopes in latitude means that night time observations for students located near the two telescopes must occur in night time hours. Students in the continental United States, the UK, and other geographical locations, can often schedule their observations during their classroom or daytime hours. \r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nBut resources are available at any time. LCOGT provides an extensive, searchable <a href=\"/search/archive\" target=\"_blank\">image archive</a> from both educational and scientific observations, and a browseable <a href=\"/images/space\" target=\"_blank\">image gallery</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Future Global Network Development</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nIn the near future, LCOGT will expand their global network to as many as eight sites around the globe, hosting three classes of telescope. The 2-meter Faulkes telescopes will remain in operation. In addition, there will be up to 16 1-meter telescopes and as many as 24 40cm telescopes. Each class of telescope supports an array of scientific explorations and projects,and will have time available for amateur and educational astrophysics use.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nBecause of the geographic spread of the telescopes, users will be able to make real-time observations in night skies at any time. The first installation of 1-meter and 40cm telescopes will take place in Cerro Tololo, Chile during 2011. LCOGT will soon be true to their slogan, We Keep You in the Dark.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Research Endeavors Continue</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nThe educational program wins converts wherever it touches down. In a letter dated August 6<sup>th</sup>, Mr. Pfluke's assistant and mother, Anastasia Pfluke, wrote to Wayne Rosing, founder and president of LCOGT, that the “Faulkes time turned into one of the most special nights we've spent on Maui (and if you've ever been here, you know that's saying a lot).”\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nMr. Pfluke is continuing his research on the Faulkes telescopes. “I was researching an NEO, T38512, with Dr. J. D. Pan-STARRS discovered it very recently,” he wrote to Mr. Rosing. “I obviously couldn't have done the research without the Faulkes.” NEO is insider terminology for Near-Earth Objects, typically comets and asteroids in orbits near the Earth. Pan-STARRS-1 is the <a href=\"http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public\" target=\"_blank\">Panoramic Survey Telescope &amp; Rapid Response System</a>, a program in which LCOGT is a half-partner with Harvard-Smithsonian. \r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nHowever, T38512 remains unconfirmed. “We attempted to recover T38512 a couple of weeks ago,” Dr. Armstrong said, “but instead saw another asteroid. To the best of my knowledge T38512 was never recovered. It would have been Pan-STARRS second NEO.<span> </span>It was a long shot to try and catch it, but the payoff would have been well worth the investment. Since the asteroid that Anthony and I did see needs some follow-up observations, we are planning on doing that later this month.”\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Publication Demands</h2>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nPublished on Maui for a select distribution for several years now, The Pfluke Times is time-consuming to create – it is nearly all hand-written – and so is issued on an irregular schedule. Subscriptions are isolated to immediate family at this writing, however the firm is considering a transition to web publication in the near future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\nMs. Pfluke did note that the experience had a detrimental effect on play time for Mr. Pfluke. “On our second day working on that first Faulkes worksheet, the neighbor kids came to see if he could play, and he didn't even ask me if he could go; he just told them he'd be out as soon as he was done. He wanted to finish his astronomy first.”\r\n</p>\r\n",

A presentation of the progress was presented at the meeting of the Science Advisory Committee last week, all of whom were very impressed with how far the software has come and the capabilities it will have.</p><br /><p> </p><p> </p>",

His report is below.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann\">Comet 29P/ Schwassmann-Wachmann </a>orbits in a relatively cool region of the solar system more than 6 AU from the sun and yet it is the most active periodic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet\">comet</a> known. Normally comets become active as they approach a close <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion\">perihelion</a> where solar heating is important. For this comet the evidence suggests that carbon monoxide is the main driver of its outbursts. Amateur astronomers regularly monitor the comet looking for such outbursts. On January 20 Spanish amateur Faustino Garcia (J38) reported a small outburst of comet 29P.

This is a huge accomplishment, congratulations to the team!</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Sinistro will be the main science instrument on the <a href=\"https://secure.lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> telescopes. It consists of a 16 million pixel high sensitivity camera, a 21 position filter wheel with integral photometric shutter, and a high speed off axis autoguider. Additionally the instrument has three additional ports designed to support a medium resolution spectrograph (MRES) fiber feed and a high-speed photometry camera (LuckyOne). Projected on the sky, Sinistro&#39;s pixels are 0.39 arcseconds across with a total field of view of 26.6 arcminutes square.<br /><br />The Sinistro camera consists of a 4096 X 4097 X 15 um pixel <a href=\"https://secure.lcogt.net/network/ccd/fairchild-ccd486-bi\">Fairchild Imaging CCD486</a>, an LCOGT designed vacuum cryostat with integral gauge and ion pump, a closed cycle cryogenic refrigerator, and an LCOGT designed CCD controller. The controller uses a novel DC coupled design to remove the large DC level present on the output signal. It also does the typical filtering (integration) in the digital domain so that readout speed, dynamic range, digital sampling, and spatial resolution can be optimized on a program specific basis. The prototype supports four channels of input at up to 1 Mpix/s/channel sampling, although it is presently being run at about 400 kpix/s aggregate throughput.<br /><br />First image with Sinistro camera (bottom right). A 1 s exposure at approximately f/64. The electronics lab lights were off and only a desk lamp was illuminating the scene. The hand of LCOGT science director, Tim Brown, is for scale. Pixels are analog binned 4x4 for faster readout, and the camera is operating at a relatively warm -15 &#39;C for testing purposes. The readout was done through four amplifiers in parallel (in the corners) and the dark bands separating quadrants are overscan pixels that are not part of the physical array. The vertical banding is likely a result of improperly tuned parallel clocks, and the faint splotches in the upper portion of the image are regions of lower sensitivity on the detector.</p>",

Rachel Ross and Robert Paulson of LCOGT attended, as well as Fred Marschak and one of this students from <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">Santa Barbara City College</a>.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">The evening began with a group of about 50 fifth grade students along with teachers and parents.

There was then a round of “Are You As Smart As A Fifth Grader” where the parents went up against the students where the students won by a landslide, 8 to 2!  Afterwards was a short hike up the hill to learn about stars and constellations with a night sky tour given by Rachel and observing through three different telescopes, including the <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">0.8m Byrne Observatory</a> (BOS), a 178mm <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">Astro-Physics</a> refractor, and an 8” <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">Meade</a><a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\"> </a>Schmidt-cassegrain.

With a smaller group and more time flexibility, we got to look at several objects through the BOS including the Orion Nebula (M42), the <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">Crab Nebula</a> (M1) (and the group learned a new technical astronomy term – <em>fuzzy blob</em>), the <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">Pleiades</a>(M45), and open cluster <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">M41</a>. We even had some time to participate in this years <a href=\"#mce_temp_url#\">Globe at Night</a> campaign!</p><p>The sky was mostly clear, the weather calm but cold, and both groups were very enthusiastic … all in all, it was a great kick off to the 2011 season of star parties!</p>",

          "value": "<p>\r\nThis past week Stuart and I joined a host of technology savvy astronomers in <a href=\"http://www.new.ox.ac.uk\">New College</a>, Oxford University (although being 'new' is relative because it was founded in 1379) for <a href=\"http://dotastronomy.com\">.astronomy 3</a>. It is a grand conference venue and it is unsurprising to learn it was used as a set in the Harry Potter films. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://dotastronomy.com\">.astronomy</a> (pronounced 'dot astronomy') is hard to define, but brings together people who work in astronomy and want to explore web and emerging technologies. The fruits of this, benefit research, outreach, and the grey area in between (as demonstrated by Zooniverse and Citizen Science Alliance). It brings together a mixture of traditional researchers, coding and web experts, people who blog about science, and exciting things happen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe week did not follow the usual structure for conferences, with every afternoon being left open for informal &quot;unconference&quot; sessions to be arranged ad-hoc, and Tuesday afternoon (and into the late night) being reserved for a &quot;hack day&quot;. Every morning there were talks with 2 excellent keynote speakers and 13 other invited speakers (myself included).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJill Tarter, Seti Institute and David Hogg, NYU gave excellent keynote talks ranging from the search for extraterrestrial life to why a kitten was mistaken for a comet. You can find them and all the talks on the<a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/.astronomy\"> USteam channel for dotastronomy</a>. In truth, I was slightly star-struck at meeting Jill, and hope I didn't embarress myself. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI gave a short introduction to LCOGT and gave demos of some of our recently released web apps, particularly <a href=\"/virtualsky\">Virtual Sky</a>, <a href=\"/observations\">Observations</a>, and the alpha release of <a href=\"/siab\">Star in a Box</a>. If you missed the talk completely or the UStream cut out on you, you can <a href=\"/files/egomez/lcogtdotastronomy2011.pdf\">download a copy of my slides</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome of the other marvellous things from .astronomy were: Jonathan Fay (Microsoft) exploring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shGvLECVpS8\">World Wide Telescope using a Kinect</a>, by waving his arms in the air;<a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~trobitaille/\"> Thomas Robitaille</a> (CFA) on exploring the Virtual Observatory with his python library <a href=\"http://atpy.github.com/\">ATpy</a>; <a href=\"http://mygroundstations.com/\">Michael Johnson</a> on launching matchbox sized satellites into orbit for education science projects; <a href=\"http://chrislintott.net/\">Chris Lintott</a> (<a href=\"http://zooniverse.net\">Zooniverse</a>) on why the internet is terrible, and how we can make it better.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral videos were produced during the conference (see Markus Pössel's <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22025233\">The .A Team</a>, and Boris Haeussler's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKhNAAQOzj0\">Why the network broke</a>), but my favourite is the musical number <a href=\"http://youpiter.org/pluto/\">Pluto the Previous Planet</a>, written by and starring <a href=\"http://amandabauer.blogspot.com/\">Amanda Bauer</a> (she's a super science fellow in AAO, but she doesn't wear a cape to work).

          "safe_value": "<p>\nThis past week Stuart and I joined a host of technology savvy astronomers in <a href=\"http://www.new.ox.ac.uk\">New College</a>, Oxford University (although being 'new' is relative because it was founded in 1379) for <a href=\"http://dotastronomy.com\">.astronomy 3</a>. It is a grand conference venue and it is unsurprising to learn it was used as a set in the Harry Potter films. \n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://dotastronomy.com\">.astronomy</a> (pronounced 'dot astronomy') is hard to define, but brings together people who work in astronomy and want to explore web and emerging technologies. The fruits of this, benefit research, outreach, and the grey area in between (as demonstrated by Zooniverse and Citizen Science Alliance). It brings together a mixture of traditional researchers, coding and web experts, people who blog about science, and exciting things happen.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe week did not follow the usual structure for conferences, with every afternoon being left open for informal &quot;unconference&quot; sessions to be arranged ad-hoc, and Tuesday afternoon (and into the late night) being reserved for a &quot;hack day&quot;. Every morning there were talks with 2 excellent keynote speakers and 13 other invited speakers (myself included).\n</p>\n<p>\nJill Tarter, Seti Institute and David Hogg, NYU gave excellent keynote talks ranging from the search for extraterrestrial life to why a kitten was mistaken for a comet. You can find them and all the talks on the<a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/.astronomy\"> USteam channel for dotastronomy</a>. In truth, I was slightly star-struck at meeting Jill, and hope I didn't embarress myself. \n</p>\n<p>\nI gave a short introduction to LCOGT and gave demos of some of our recently released web apps, particularly <a href=\"/virtualsky\">Virtual Sky</a>, <a href=\"/observations\">Observations</a>, and the alpha release of <a href=\"/siab\">Star in a Box</a>. If you missed the talk completely or the UStream cut out on you, you can <a href=\"/files/egomez/lcogtdotastronomy2011.pdf\">download a copy of my slides</a>. \n</p>\n<p>\nSome of the other marvellous things from .astronomy were: Jonathan Fay (Microsoft) exploring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shGvLECVpS8\">World Wide Telescope using a Kinect</a>, by waving his arms in the air;<a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~trobitaille/\"> Thomas Robitaille</a> (CFA) on exploring the Virtual Observatory with his python library <a href=\"http://atpy.github.com/\">ATpy</a>; <a href=\"http://mygroundstations.com/\">Michael Johnson</a> on launching matchbox sized satellites into orbit for education science projects; <a href=\"http://chrislintott.net/\">Chris Lintott</a> (<a href=\"http://zooniverse.net\">Zooniverse</a>) on why the internet is terrible, and how we can make it better.\n</p>\n<p>\nSeveral videos were produced during the conference (see Markus Pössel's <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22025233\">The .A Team</a>, and Boris Haeussler's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKhNAAQOzj0\">Why the network broke</a>), but my favourite is the musical number <a href=\"http://youpiter.org/pluto/\">Pluto the Previous Planet</a>, written by and starring <a href=\"http://amandabauer.blogspot.com/\">Amanda Bauer</a> (she's a super science fellow in AAO, but she doesn't wear a cape to work).

The structure is steel framed and laterally wrapped with both steel bands and corrugated exterior siding for lateral strength. Strong-Wall columns provide additional weight bearing capacity.</p><p>A distinct design requirement was to make the walls modular. Built and finished in a Santa Barbara warehouse, each wall set breaks down into six segments that can be moved individually by three workers, and a set of fasteners and preassembled electrical drops. Reconstruction on-site for three complete wall sets is expected to require approximately one work week with a crew of four.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The containers are expected to arrive in Chile and be deposited on site in late July. Additional components and documentation will be delivered to site via air freight, and construction is likely to be completed during August.</p>",

I was restructuring the web framework and realized that JSON data is much easier to parse and use in the browser than XML. It's also just easier to read.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat I didn't realize was valid JSON names shouldn't include dashes/hyphens, so I happily named a <strong>bunch</strong> of multi-word variables variable-one, variable-two, etc. <em>Don't worry, I use more descriptive names than those!</em> Everything was fine until I tried to run some fancy javascript on one of these variables, and the dash caused it to barf. I knew the time would come; I'd have to change all of those variable names, replacing dashes with underscores. Not only did this mean I had to change the names that were written out in command responses, but also in the HTML forms that displayed the different variables because I had javascript that automatically populated the proper fields with the right data when the response is received in the browser.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nToday that time came. Manually editing every variable isn't an option for me. There's a possibility it could be faster, but I'd end up insane. Plus, I'm a programmer, there's a smarter way to do this!\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Introducing sed</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nSed is a little command line tool for editing a stream of text. One of the popular uses is to replace text in a file. I had to hammer a little rust off my regex skills, but I finally came up with a command to replace &quot;-&quot; with &quot;_&quot;.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nfor file in `find . -name &quot;*.c&quot;`; do sed -e &quot;s/([a-z0-9])-([a-z0-9])/1_2/g&quot; -e &quot;s/([a-z0-9])%d/1_%d/g&quot; -e &quot;s/([a-z])([0-9])/1_2/g&quot; $file &gt; temp; mv temp $file; done\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are actually three replace commands embedded in there, but it did the trick. And then some. There were a handful of things I didn't prepare for, and had to go back and revert some of the edits.  Sed was also useful for those fixes, as well as svn diff and grep. Lots of command line fun today! \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Testing the changes</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nOverall, the replacement went pretty well. It took about twice as long to build each project, install the new versions, and test each one. There were a couple hiccups, but more use of svn diff and svn revert proved useful again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLesson learned: Define string representation of variable names in one place. \r\n</p>\r\n",

Plus, I'm a programmer, there's a smarter way to do this!\n</p>\n<h2>Introducing sed</h2>\n<p>\nSed is a little command line tool for editing a stream of text. One of the popular uses is to replace text in a file. I had to hammer a little rust off my regex skills, but I finally came up with a command to replace \"-\" with \"_\".\n</p>\n<p>\nfor file in `find . -name \"*.c\"`; do sed -e \"s/([a-z0-9])-([a-z0-9])/1_2/g\" -e \"s/([a-z0-9])%d/1_%d/g\" -e \"s/([a-z])([0-9])/1_2/g\" $file &gt; temp; mv temp $file; done\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are actually three replace commands embedded in there, but it did the trick. And then some. There were a handful of things I didn't prepare for, and had to go back and revert some of the edits.  Sed was also useful for those fixes, as well as svn diff and grep. Lots of command line fun today! \n</p>\n<h2>Testing the changes</h2>\n<p>\nOverall, the replacement went pretty well. It took about twice as long to build each project, install the new versions, and test each one. There were a couple hiccups, but more use of svn diff and svn revert proved useful again.\n</p>\n<p>\nLesson learned: Define string representation of variable names in one place. \n</p>",

It was entirely designed by our optical and imaging engineers and was constructed in the LCOGT image lab.

It&#39;s fantastically cool to me that every thing those photons touched after they got through the atmosphere was engineered, assembled, tested, and in many cases actually made by someone at LCO. Outside of <a href=\"http://eso.org\">ESO</a> there&#39;s not a lot of observatories that can say that!&quot;, said <a href=\"/user/jtufts\">Joe Tufts</a>, one of the scientists working on this project.</p><p>Sinistro, Italian for &#39;left&#39; (because lefties are always in their right brain) is the camera system designed specifically for our <a href=\"/network/1m\">1-meter telescope</a> network. It is based on existing <a href=\"/network/instrumentation/lcogt-f4k\">Fairchild Imaging CCD 486 BI</a> devices, and uses the first generation LCOGT detector controller capable of 4 Mpix/s, ~10 e-/pix, and 16-bit dynamic range. The science CCD is cryocooled with a closed cycle chiller to -100&ordm;C to decrease thermal noise, and housed in a vacuum (8e-8 mbar) cryostat for insulation. It is read out through four amplifiers simultaneously (in the corners, which explains the split image) to decrease readout time. The custom camera, controller, and instrument allows us to optimize each element in the system for LCOGT&#39;s primary science mission, scintillation-limited broad-band photometry of time varying sources.</p><p>Immediately in front of the camera it is a disk type photometric shutter which ensures every pixel is exposed for exactly the same amount of time. This shutter, about the size of a dinner plate, can spin from closed to open to closed in only 250 ms. In front of the shutter is a filter changing mechanism which supports 21 different filters of astronomical interest and can change between any two in &lt; 6 s. Finally, sky side of the filter changer are four auxillary ports which pick off large fields 40 arcminutes off center from the primary Sinistro field. Each auxillary instrument has independent focusing and corrector optics and is theoretically diffraction limited.</p><p>The sinistro instrument is more advanced than any other we have previously had in our astronomical arsenal. Congratulations to all of Team Sinistro - Joe Tufts, Rich Lobdill, Annie Hjelstrom,Ben Haldeman, Rachel Haynes, Ben Burleson, Eric Hawkins, Tim Lister, and many more at LCOGT!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Several million people tuned in for three nights to watch live updates from telescopes around the world. LCOGT, and the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/\">Faulkes Telescope Project</a>, helped Dara use <a href=\"/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">Faulkes Telescope North</a> in Hawaii to take <a href=\"/observations/user/4386\">some images</a> which ended up on the show.</p><p>Last week, Edward Gomez (LCOGT Education Director) was in touch with Dara about more observing using Faulkes North. This wasn&#39;t for a TV show but Dara had enjoyed using the telescope in January and was interested in using it again. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/daraobriain/status/99445958584176640\">Dara asked his Twitter followers</a> if they wanted to join in and suggest objects to look at during a live observing session. He suggested people tag their tweets with #ShowMeStars.</p><p>Today, at 12 noon GMT, Dara&#39;s session started. Ed and I had prepared a special <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/showmestars/\">Show Me Stars</a> web page to display the results, <a href=\"#!/search/%23showmestars\">the tweets</a>, a live <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/webcams#ogg\">webcam view from Hawaii</a> and a <a href=\"/virtualsky\">Virtual Sky</a>. Shortly after Dara&#39;s first tweet our web server started to struggle and many people (including us) were getting blank pages as the server failed to keep up with the demand. We&#39;d been expecting a bit of traffic but it turns out we hadn&#39;t anticipated the amount we got. At our office in Cardiff, we immediately started lightening the load on the server. I moved some of our files (CSS, Javascript and images) off onto <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon&#39;s Web Services</a> (AWS). One of the benefits of AWS is that it can scale with demand so it coped admirably with the sudden increase in traffic during the session. It noticeably improved things and the complaints about blank screens soon reduced.</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/daraobriain/status/100904918214377472\">Dara&#39;s first observation</a> of <a href=\"/observations/ogg/2m0a/61407\">M27 the Dumbbell Nebula</a> came through at 12:19 GMT. It had taken a little while because he did a very long exposure. Although a lot longer than necessary (540s in each colour filter) the results are really good. He then went on to get lovely spiral galaxy <a href=\"/observations/ogg/2m0a/61408\">NGC 6946</a> and finally an image of <a href=\"/observations/ogg/2m0a/61409\">Comet Garradd</a> (C/2009 P1) with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/daraobriain/statuses/100914384909516800\">only 19 seconds to spare</a> before his session ended!</p><p>During the hour, the Twitter stream went a little crazy and tweets are still coming in 2 hours after it finished. Many thousands of people were able to view the webpage, ask questions, and experience a bit of the universe during their lunch hour. It was stressful for those of us at LCOGT - and for Dara! - but a brilliant event and I can&#39;t wait for us to do another in the future.</p><p>When asked about his observing experience Dara said, &quot;Many thanks to all at Las Cumbres Observatory for the kind offer of time on Faulkes Telescope North. I feel guilty that their reward was for me to crash their servers by directing too many people to them. Still no good deed goes unpunished. If it&#39;s any comfort it&#39;s also a sign of how many people chose to spend their lunchtime with me, traversing the skies, looking at the awe-inspiring sights of the cosmos. And well done to LCOGT for offering that access halfway across the world.&quot;</p><p>Finally, huge thanks to the JD Armstrong and the <a href=\"http://ifa.hawaii.edu/\">Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii</a> for providing the telescope time for <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/showmestars/\">Show Me Stars</a>.</p>",

The theme was Connecting People to Science and featured many great speakers and sessions.

Other plenary sessions included talks on the power of perspective, a panel on engaging girls in STEM subjects, planning and evaluating informal science programs, and new views of Mercury and the Moon.\r\n<p>\r\nThere were many great poster presentations about the local and global education and outreach programs, activities, events, studies, and more.

The ever-expanding <a href=\"http://www.zooniverse.org/\">Zooniverse</a> was present for several sessions, as well as dark skies awareness with <a href=\"http://www.globeatnight.org/\">Globe at Night</a> and other organizations, using online data archives in the classroom, various ways to promote STEM subjects, teacher training groups such as GTTP, and many others.

          "value": "<p>\r\nBuilding a photometric shutter can be a complicated task. The goal is to expose every pixel of the CCD for the exact same window of time. However, since we have to live within the bounds of reality, we must cope with the fact that the shutter cannot physically open and close instantaneously. The next best option is to expose every pixel for the exact same <em>amount</em> of time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe shutter designed for the 1.0m Sinistro imaging package is a round nylon composite disk with cut-outs (see the Shutter disk image and the Shutter dimensions drawing) that rotates around the center axis of the disk; it looks like Pacman. When the cut-out is positioned over the CCD, photos from the sky are allowed to collect in the CCD, creating an image of the sky. Keep in mind three states of the shutter relating to an exposure:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Shutter closed, with cut-out positioned in a negative direction (counter-clockwise) from the CCD field of view. This is the position shown in the picture.</li>\r\n\t<li>Shutter open, cut-out is centered over the CCD field of view.</li>\r\n\t<li>Shutter closed, with cut-out positioned in a positive direction (clockwise) from the CCD field of view.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nThe two closed states are important because a single exposure uses all three states to expose each pixel of the CCD for the same amount of time. Each exposure consists of two moves: 1) from state 1 to state 2, and 2) from state 2 to state 3. Both moves are in the same direction, so the cut-out leaves the CCD field of view on the opposite side it entered. The next exposure just reverses the procedure, but follows the same rules. See the Shutter Exposure video to see two 2-second exposures; you will notice the first exposure consists of two moves, then the second exposure consists of two moves in the opposite direction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow the tricky part: exposing every pixel the same amount of time. Because the transit of the edge of the cut-out across the CCD field of view takes a non-zero amount of time, by the time the cut-out is fully exposing the CCD, pixels near the edge of the CCD where the shutter cut-out started the move have had more time to collect photons from the sky!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThink of it this way: picture a stage in a theater with a big heavy curtain across the front. Behind the curtain are three flashing lightbulbs that flash once every second. They are spaced evenly across the stage, from left to right. You're sitting in the audience, so you can't see the flashing lights yet. But as the curtain is drawn across the stage (this one goes left to right, not up and down!) you start seeing one lightbulb flashing. You see it flash four times, then as the curtain is drawn further across the stage, you see a second lightbulb. Finally, you see the third lightbulb. All three lightbulbs have been flashing at the same rate, but you saw the first bulb flash 12 times, the second flash 8 times, and the third only 4 times! So in your snapshot of the lights on stage (i.e. your exposure), you saw a different amount of light from each bulb, even though we know they were all emitting at the same rate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow do we solve this problem? To continue with the example, we need a second curtain that has been hiding offstage to be pulled across the stage at the same rate as the first curtain. The rate of travel is important because you can think of the sky as an infinite array of lights and every one deserves the same amount of time so we can accurately measure its light!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo reiterate the key to solving this problem, as the shutter transitions over the CCD field of view, it must be moving at a constant speed. This applies both for when it is transitioning to the open position, and when it is transitioning to the closed position. If the speed is constant (and the same between both moves), we can be confident that each pixel is being exposed for the same amount of time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow, how do we get the contsant speed? If we look at the shutter dimensions drawing, it shows that the shutter has approximately 112 degrees to move from closed position to open (and vice-versa). We also see that the shutter has approximately a 14 degree window to get to up to speed before transitioning across the CCD field of view. So, now we know we need a 112 degree move and we must reach maximum velocity within the first 14 degrees of the move.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLucky for me, our controller includes a <a href=\"http://www.pmdcorp.com/advanced-motion-control/advanced-motion-control.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Magellan Motion Processor MC580000\">PMD motion processor</a> that makes defining the motion profile pretty simple. I normally use an S-curve profile because it provides the smoothest motion, but due to the 14 degree acceleration window constraint, I'm using a trapezoidal profile to simplify the math. Using some physics equations (thanks to my colleague Strawberry), we found the relationship between maximum velocity and acceleration, to meet the 14 degree target. This relationship allowed me to write a routine to tune the speed of the shutter using a single input for the maximum velocity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe routine starts with a large velocity, attempts a move equal to the distance of a shutter open move, then checks the encoder position to see if it was actually able to complete the move. If the velocity or acceleration is too high, the motor does not have enough power to perform the move, so the maximum velocity is reduced, and the move is attempted again. This is performed until the move is successful, according to the encoder position. The routine also writes the motion profile out as JSON data, then uses flot to plot the profile.\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/vPWX7JZjS2I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the Shutter motion profile image, in the top plot, the yellow line is shutter position (the left axis) and you can see it runs from 0 to 112 degrees. The bottom axis is time in milliseconds. The blue and red lines are shutter speed in degrees/msec, the blue is commanded, or planned by the motion profile generator, and the red is actual computed from values read off the encoder. The bottom image shows commanded and actual shutter speeds vs shutter position. The thin green line in the bottom plot is the 14.4 degree target where the shutter must be at constant velocity. The green shading in both plots shows the regions where the shutter is either acceleration or decelerating, as opposed to the white section in the middle, where it is at constant (maximum) speed. You can see we have achived the goal of reaching constant speed within the window, and the move took approximately 130 msec.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo take this further, the measured transit times can be used as part of an exposure time calculation to make actual pixel exposure time more accurate. You may also have noticed that the disk has a small slit opposite of the large cut-out; for even higher-speed exposures, this will be swept across the CCD field of view.\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZOK34IlPmA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n",

This will allow us to tell more astronomers all sorts of interesting physics e.g. about the type of supernova it was, varify the massive of the original star, whether more than one star was involved, and verify how closely it match theories the physics of supernovae. We were very lucky that this supernova explosion (called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2011dh\">SN2011dh</a>) was discovered very soon after the event occured. Using LCOGT telescopes ( <a href=\"/network/partner-telescopes/sedgwick-reserve-observatory\">Byrne Observatory Sedgwick</a>, <a href=\"/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">Faulkes Telescope North</a> , and <a href=\"/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-south\">Faulkes Telescope South</a>  ), our supernova astronomers (led by <a href=\"/user/ahowell\">Andy Howell</a>) have been observing SN2011dh nearly every night since it's discovery, resulting in a high quality lightcurve.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of our astronomers, <a href=\"/user/bfulton\">BJ Fulton</a>, has produced a movie of the results he has collected from BOS so far. As the brightness of the supernova changes in the image you can see how the graph changes. \n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3uaQmT670XU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\nCongratulations to all involved in the observing! Thanks to our educational affiliates I<a href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/haleakalanew/index.shtml\">nstitute for Astronomy, Maui</a> and the <a href=\"http://faulkes-telescope.com\">Faulkes Telescope Project</a>, both of whose users who have been involved in observing this supernova with our 2m telescopes. \n</p>\n",

The video is not in real time and represents many hours of observations, compiled into less than 30 seconds.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/6ifqknfDHus?rel=0\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"/user/tlister\">Tim Lister</a> adds &quot;The flyby of 2005 YU55 is the closest approach of an object this size (~400m; larger than an aircraft carrier) to the Earth since 1976. Although there is no chance this object will hit the Earth now or in the next hundred years, the close pass enables us to obtain a wealth of data on a <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/book/asteroids-and-neos\">Near Earth Object</a> (NEO) that we couldn&#39;t normally get. At the point of closest approach on 2011 November 8 at 23:28 UTC (3:28pm PST), 2005 YU55 was 85% of the Earth-Moon distance or about 200,000 miles. New NEOs are being found all the time, particularly by the <a href=\"http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/\">Pan STARRS</a> Consortium, of which LCOGT is a member. New discoverys from PanSTARRS are regularly observed and confirmed by LCOGT&#39;s telescopes, including <a href=\"/network/partner-telescopes/sedgwick-reserve-observatory\">Sedgwick</a>.&quot;</p>",

Then for my last year of college (yes, it is 5 years in Italy) I went on an exchange program to UPenn. I stayed there for the first two years of grad school, and I ended up doing my thesis research at the <a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Smithsonian center for Astrophysics</a>. I have many interests in astronomy, maybe too many! I&rsquo;m interested in the outer solar system, blind and predicted occultation surveys, supernovae, time series, and there&rsquo;s a new thing I&rsquo;ve been working on called &ldquo;light echoes.&rdquo; They are really exciting and what they are is when there is a supernova or a nova, any kind of explosion in space, the light leaves the explosion and travels in every direction. Sometimes we see the event directly, but also light from one of these events may encounter a cloud of dust and be reflected back toward us, so then we are seeing the event&rsquo;s echo!</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What led you to the career/job you are doing now? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">FB: I really enjoy being in school and continuing to learn, and this allows me to keep doing that!</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What is a typical day at work like? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">FB: I like to try to find long periods of time to get things done, but realistically my time is usually broken up into 20-40 minute chunks. Usually when I&rsquo;m working on something, an email or a meeting comes along so I end up moving from project to project throughout the day. I don&rsquo;t really have a standard routine. I check emails before I get up in the morning to check if there has been some cosmic explosion that requires my attention. I have a flexible schedule and usually get to work around 9 or 10. Somewhere during the morning or at lunch I usually go for a run. Then I work until 5, go train (I am a martial arts enthusiast and practice capoeira and box), go home, have dinner, then I usually work some more until pretty late at night, often 1am.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">FB: You need to know that this is a very career focused job.

Then for my last year of college (yes, it is 5 years in Italy) I went on an exchange program to UPenn. I stayed there for the first two years of grad school, and I ended up doing my thesis research at the <a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\">Harvard Smithsonian center for Astrophysics</a>. I have many interests in astronomy, maybe too many! I&rsquo;m interested in the outer solar system, blind and predicted occultation surveys, supernovae, time series, and there&rsquo;s a new thing I&rsquo;ve been working on called &ldquo;light echoes.&rdquo; They are really exciting and what they are is when there is a supernova or a nova, any kind of explosion in space, the light leaves the explosion and travels in every direction. Sometimes we see the event directly, but also light from one of these events may encounter a cloud of dust and be reflected back toward us, so then we are seeing the event&rsquo;s echo!</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What led you to the career/job you are doing now? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">FB: I really enjoy being in school and continuing to learn, and this allows me to keep doing that!</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What is a typical day at work like? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">FB: I like to try to find long periods of time to get things done, but realistically my time is usually broken up into 20-40 minute chunks. Usually when I&rsquo;m working on something, an email or a meeting comes along so I end up moving from project to project throughout the day. I don&rsquo;t really have a standard routine. I check emails before I get up in the morning to check if there has been some cosmic explosion that requires my attention. I have a flexible schedule and usually get to work around 9 or 10. Somewhere during the morning or at lunch I usually go for a run. Then I work until 5, go train (I am a martial arts enthusiast and practice capoeira and box), go home, have dinner, then I usually work some more until pretty late at night, often 1am.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">FB: You need to know that this is a very career focused job.

That means I have to figure out what shape the mirrors and/or lenses have to be in whatever instrument I&#39;m working on. My latest project was designing a <a href=\"https://secure.lcogt.net/blog/rross/floyds-first-light\">spectrograph</a>, which had three mirrors, one lens, a prism and a diffraction grating. In addition to doing the optical design, I also have to tolerance the system. The process of tolerancing is basically figuring out how &quot;not perfect&quot; any of the optics can be and have the entire instrument still perform within spec. Because the wavelength of light is so small, even the smallest deformations on an optical surface can be a really big deal. For example, the primary mirror for our 1.0 meter telescope is only allowed to have errors of about 32 nanometers.

In total, there were 10 star parties, as well as a rainy, midday show-and-tell with the observatory. These groups ranged from elementary school groups, family groups, outdoor school groups, youth enrichment programs, college student groups, auctioned events, the California natural reserve system managers, the annual LCOGT star party, and others.</p>\r\n<p>Much of the data for <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/agentexoplanet/\">Agent Exoplanet</a> also came from the BOS. Earlier this year when we were preparing for Agent Exoplanet, we weren't sure about the quality of the data and if it would hold up against <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">FTN</a> and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-south\">FTS</a>. Just after a couple of trial transits which showed the data to be quite reliable, we switched gears and it is now our primary resource for gathering extrasolar planet data. Approximately 75-80% of the full-transit data sets that we have for Agent Exoplanet are from BOS.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Science</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>The BOS has also been used for significant science research over the past year, observing about 90% of clear nights.

In total, there were 10 star parties, as well as a rainy, midday show-and-tell with the observatory. These groups ranged from elementary school groups, family groups, outdoor school groups, youth enrichment programs, college student groups, auctioned events, the California natural reserve system managers, the annual LCOGT star party, and others.</p>\n<p>Much of the data for <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/agentexoplanet/\">Agent Exoplanet</a> also came from the BOS. Earlier this year when we were preparing for Agent Exoplanet, we weren't sure about the quality of the data and if it would hold up against <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">FTN</a> and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-south\">FTS</a>. Just after a couple of trial transits which showed the data to be quite reliable, we switched gears and it is now our primary resource for gathering extrasolar planet data. Approximately 75-80% of the full-transit data sets that we have for Agent Exoplanet are from BOS.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Science</strong>:</p>\n<p>The BOS has also been used for significant science research over the past year, observing about 90% of clear nights.

Sometime around age 15, I started working for the LCOGT founder. My job was taking care of dirty jobs: &nbsp;Clearing hillsides of brush, feeding and babysitting burn piles, sweeping, organizing, demolition, construction, and moving things from A to B. Eventually, I worked my way up into machining/CAD work and helped build a large robotic telescope (<a href=\"http://www.rainwaterobservatory.org/rainwater/\">Rainwater</a>).</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">I went to UCSB then UC Berkeley for a Masters in Mechanical Engineering. At that point I put my education to use and became a professional cyclist. In 2005, I quit racing and started working full-time at LCOGT. &nbsp;At that point LCOGT was a small shop on Haley St. in Santa Barbara.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">My interests include: rock climbing, kite surfing, mountain/road biking, running, surfing, skiing, kayaking, and traveling. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What is a typical day at work like? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">MD: I&#39;ll let you know when I experience one.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#073763;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? </span><br /><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">MD: Surround yourself with smart people.

x 10&#39; x 8&#39; space, we had something from many of the niches of LCOGT. &nbsp;This included a world map with a shadow moving across the face with the telescope sites changing from red to green as night fell on those sites projecting on a 50&rdquo; TV to emphasis the capabilities of the network (created by BJ Fulton and Jessica Barton), a 1-meter filter wheel (which will be part of <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/rross/first-photons-sinistro\">Sinistro</a>) which happily spun around awing everyone for the entire week, the moving focuser and filter wheel for the high speed camera, slides shows about the main science areas that LCOGT scientists are participating in and all of the software and engineering being done, and a laptop set up where everyone can try out the education software such as <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a>. &nbsp;The background panels began with a <a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060104.html\">photo</a> by Rob Ratkowski/Maui and was edited by Federica Bianco to include silhouettes of <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/1m\">1-meter</a> and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/0.4m\">0.4-meter</a> telescopes next to FTN.</p><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1346\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"262\",\"id\":\"1\",\"style\":\"width: 350px;

BJ, Ben, and Andy also contributed to both the paper and talk.</li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/mgraham\">Melissa</a> presented rates of core collapse supernovae (type II-P) in galaxy clusters with the MENeaCS (Multi-Epoch Nearby Cluster Survey) survey using data that spanned two years. &nbsp;Also presented were the ratio between Ia and II rates, the properties of the supernova host galaxies, and the implied star formation rate.</li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/ahowell\">Andy</a> presented the lightcurves (griz) and spectra for two ultraluminous supernovae (type Ia) from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). &nbsp;The two supernovae are of the most luminous known and most distant with a spectrum.</li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/dsand\">Dave</a> presented the type Ia supernova rate from MENeaCS which included the find of 4 hostless, intracluster SN Ia which helped to constrain the intracluster stellar mass fraction to be ~15% as well as the delay time distribution of the supernovae to help identify the progenitors. &nbsp;(Dave would also like to be quoted as saying &ldquo;BOOM.&rdquo;)</li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/ashporer\">Avi</a> presented a study on the the search for photometric orbital modulations in short-period Jupiter-mass transiting planets from Kepler. &nbsp;The modulations can include the beaming effect, tidal ellipsoidal distortion, and the reflection/heating of the companion and can be studied solely by photometry.</li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/jparrent\">Jerod</a> participated in a special session on supernovae and talked about cataloguing the observed sub-type properties of type-Ia supernovae which is essential for understanding the underlying nature of their spectra.&nbsp;The recent discovery of the nearby type-Ia supernova SN 2011fe/PTF11kly&nbsp;offers a rare opportunity to study a spectroscopically ``normal&#39;&#39; sub-type in great detail.</li></ul><h3>Posters</h3><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/tbrown\">Tim</a> presented a poster about the spectroscopic capabilities in the near future of LCOGT including FLOYDS (low resolution covering 330 nm - 1040 nm in one shot which uses 2 diffraction orders) and MRES (medium resolution fiber-fed cross-dispersed echelle which covers 380 nm - 850 nm). &nbsp;FLOYDS is aimed towards supernova classification and time-evolution studies while MRES is intended for the study of extrasolar planets as well as studies of pulsating and magnetically active stars.</li><li>Federica presented a poster presenting the BOS and FTN lightcurves of SN2011fe, the youngest supernova (type Ia) ever discovered, found only hours after exlosion.&nbsp;

Hawaii, ANU, ARI, and Robonet.) I ask that you please submit proposals anyway. &nbsp;In particular, please tell me the fraction of hours that you expect to use for fixed-group observing, for queue-scheduled observing, (flexible and monitor groups), and for ToO observing. &nbsp;I will email each of these groups separately in a few days with the number of hours that they may expect to receive this semester.</p><h2>HOW DO I APPLY?</h2><p>Instructions on how to apply for telescope time can be found on the <a href=\"http://science/article/guidelines-applying-telescope-time\">Guidelines for applying for telescope time</a> page:<br /><a href=\"../../science/article/guidelines-applying-telescope-time\" target=\"_blank\">http://lcogt.net/science/<wbr />article/guidelines-applying-<wbr />telescope-time</a><br />where you can download the Latex template and style files for your proposal.<br /><br />To submit the proposal, you will need to register at our <a href=\"/science/tac/\">2-meter proposal portal</a>:<br /><a href=\"../../science/tac/\" target=\"_blank\">http://lcogt.net/science/tac/</a><br />and then follow the Submit Proposal link.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>TYPES OF OBSERVATION</h2><p>We ask users to propose for time based on the type of observing required by their programs, as reflected in the Proposal Template. &nbsp;These types are Fixed-block, Queue-scheduled, and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. This distinction is necessary because the observation types differ with respect to the mechanism by which observations are scheduled, and the expected cost in telescope resource per hour of on-sky time.<br /><br />If you desire fixed-block time, <strong>do not</strong> pad your request to allow for possible bad weather; &nbsp;ask for what your science requires. &nbsp;The TAC will take weather into account (up to a factor of 2 padding) without your asking. &nbsp;If, however, such padding does not make sense (perhaps you wish to observe a once-in-a-century event, for which repeat observing is not possible), then please put a statement to this effect in the body of your proposal.<br /><br />If the TAC awards you fixed-block observing time for your science you will be allocated an LCOGT liaison astronomer. Please coordinate the scheduling and the particulars of your observing requirements directly with them. &nbsp;Give as much advance warning as possible so we can resolve any conflicting programs, but at least 3-5 weeks (the schedule is usually done in 2-week blocks, with requests due 3 weeks before the start of the block).</p><h2>TIME CHARGING POLICY</h2><p>The rules for how time is deducted from a user&#39;s observing program based on the observation type are as follows:</p><h3>Fixed-block Observations</h3><ul><li>For every fixed-block observation scheduled to be observed, an equal amount of time is deducted from the total available to that program in the semester, regardless of the quality of the data collected or whether any data were collected at all.</li><li>Programs may release a requested block (by contacting your LCOGT liaison) up to 7 days prior to the date of the scheduled observation. If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.</li><li>This policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.</li></ul><h3>Queue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)</h3><ul><li>These observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.</li><li>Queue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are<br />attempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality.

I study extrasolar planets using a technique called <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/book-page/gravitational-microlensing\">gravitational microlensing</a>. The <a href=\"http://star-www.st-andrews.ac.uk/astronomy\">University of St Andrews</a> is buying into LCOGT&#39;s 1.0-meter network and funding three telescopes in exchange for observing time on the network.<br /><br />Over the recent years, I have also spent an increasing amount of time on science outreach activities and education. There is no science without communication because science only becomes useful once communicated. That doesn&#39;t mean that everyone has to understand everything. The point is to get people wondering about science and using their brains. As scientists communicating with the public, we deliver the tool-kit, not the product.<br /><br />The way we communicate has changed substantially with the Web, allowing communities to form regardless of geographical location. We are being given an unprecedented opportunity to embrace diversity, and I really like the idea of taking advantage of this so people can learn from a young age in a global context. In fact, I am set to embark on bringing together school groups from different countries to jointly work on astronomy projects. I had my own exposure to diversity from a young age, growing up in Germany and having been exposed to many different places, with many trips to Italy in particular. I am now actively contributing to the development of astronomical research in Iran and Qatar, as well as embedding these countries in an international outreach network. We are very happy that our partnership with LCOGT is not limited just to forefront science, but covers education as well.<br /><br />I am also involved in science policy activities and have amongst other things provided written evidence for enquiries of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/\">Houses of Parliament</a>. I was also recently selected to the <a href=\"http://www.globalyoungacademy.org/\">Global Young Academy</a> and I am pushing hard there for projects about education, science for development, communicating science to the public, as well as providing the best possible environment for young researchers to unleash their creativity.<br /><br /><i>JB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences. </i><br />MD: I have many interests ranging from history to mathematics, from geography to computer science, from chemistry to languages, and so on. I studied physics at Dortmund in Germany where I did my undergraduate and graduate studies. I studied physics for the generic skills and opportunities I felt it provided, and fell into astronomy by chance later on by following my curiosity.<br /><br />I like to reinvent myself every three years or so. I don&#39;t like the idea of being an established scientist, I am constantly changing, questioning and doing new things. Maybe in three years time, I will be doing something that I cannot even imagine right now!<br /><br />This is why I have given up on making detailed long-term plans. We have no idea where we will be in the future. You have to follow your ambitions. Everything you are doing is part of yourself and doesn&#39;t fall into categories. Similarly, disciplinary boundaries in science don&#39;t make sense. Problems don&#39;t follow disciplinary boundaries.<br /><br /><i>JB: What led you to the career/job you are doing now?</i><br />MD: While studying physics, I tended towards theoretical particle physics, but then an opportunity arose for me in gravitational lensing (and later more specifically microlensing), which caught my interest because it was a rather new area which meant not that much work had been done, so I had a great playing field. After having completed my PhD, I got a fellowship from the <a href=\"http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp\">German Research Foundation</a> to work at the <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/\">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> in Baltimore, and then moved to <a href=\"http://www.astro.rug.nl/\">Groningen</a> in the Netherlands when I received a <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/\">Marie Curie fellowship</a>. In 2000, I was struck by poor health and was unable to work for three years. After that I received an offer from <a href=\"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/\">St Andrews</a> and went to Scotland. In 2006, I received a <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research/\">Royal Society University Research Fellowship</a> and am still in St Andrews. I have never been a post doc in the classical sense and have always had the opportunity to drive my own agenda.<br /><br /><i>JB: What is a typical day at work like? </i><br />MD: Each day is different. Being a born German, I have a plan for the day (and for the week, and for several months ahead), but not infrequently during the day something else emerges and by the end of the day, I&#39;ve ended up doing something different from my plan. My days are spent doing things like analyzing data, writing publications, thinking, developing new concepts, presenting, too much traveling, arguing the case for science, and engaging in educational and outreach activities, which includes talking to everyone about scientific endeavour.<br /><br /><i>JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? </i><br />MD: Think carefully about what it is you want to do. You can do a great job going for something you believe in. If you don&#39;t believe in what you are doing, do something different. Doing what you believe in still requires hard work and you need skills and the drive. You also need to know the difference between success and excellence. Success is meeting expectations. Excellence goes further. It&#39;s amazing what a single person can achieve if they go for it. Dreams don&#39;t need to stay dreams - they can turn into reality.<br /><br /><i>JB: How does astronomy apply to day-to-day life? </i><br />MD: We apparently have a fascination for other worlds, but this appears to be rooted in the deep interest in ourselves. Astronomy provides us with context and thereby helps us to understand humanity and its role in the nearer or farther environment. The unique remains enigmatic forever. Understanding the wider picture requires something to compare, and we actually learn from diversity. If there happens to be life on other planets, it will teach us about life on Earth. Rather frequently, the question pops up what we get from science, and in particular politicians keep asking it. But isn&#39;t it clear that being knowledgeable is advantageous to being ignorant?<br /><br /><i>JB: Do you personally think there is life on other planets?</i><br />MD: I have two answers for you to that question. The scientific answer is: we don&#39;t know. We simply lack evidence to say. The other answer is a philosophical one and comes from my personal discomfort with exactly (!) one instance of life in the huge universe. There are at least a hundred billion stars in our galaxy and at least a hundred billion galaxies in the universe. We are now finding that many of these stars have planets, and there could well be more planets than stars. If we are unique, we are the result of a fluke. The thought that we should not be here makes me shudder (although this might be true).<br /><br />By finding other instances of life in the universe, we might get a glimpse of our future, and should there be life beyond Earth, I have rather little doubt that we will find it some day - maybe even sooner rather than later. Advances in technology can cause crucial changes, and cannot be predicted, not even by Albert Einstein. When Einstein first thought about the gravitational microlensing effect, he did not believe in it becoming observable. But he could not anticipate the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor\">transistor</a> in particular, which not only revolutionized computing, but also paved the way towards our digital cameras. As a result, a phenomenon with &ldquo;no great chance&rdquo; to be observed eventually turned into a tool that is at the scientific forefront for finding very small planets. Technically, we could discover a planet with a mass as low as that of our Moon! It is the lucky-imaging cameras on the LCOGT network that could make the crucial difference.<br /><br />A lot of the research related to extraterrestrial life focuses on habitability and what is usually called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone\">habitable zone</a>, but this is a reflection of Earth-centric prejudice and speculation. We don&#39;t know the probability or the conditions required for life. There are at least three ways to look for extraterrestrial life: go to other bodies in the Solar System, look for atmospheric signatures from <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/news/metro/exoplanets/\">exoplanets</a>, and <a href=\"http://setilive.org/\">look for signals from other intelligent civilizations</a>. The question about life beyond Earth is probably as old as humankind itself. Imagination is important and speculation has its role, but if we want to find life, we have to explore.<br /><br /><i>JB: Thanks Martin!</i></p>",

This new version hopes to provide a more user friendly experience that provides the data more clearly, is more accessible, and significantly faster. It will have support across multiple browsers, does not require Javascript, and contains extra support for those with disabilities.</p><p>The Weather Vizualization project began its development in the summer of 2010 with the goal to provide a web application for viewing the live data LCOGT was currently collecting at site &ndash; specifically, the weather data. I began my internship here under the directive to take on and complete this project. The first months were spent learning about the <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django framework</a> and experimenting with the various graphing libraries and methods used to collect user input. Soon, <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/esaunders\">Eric Saunders</a> would join the project as a mentor and consulting software engineer. His help proved an invaluable asset to the success of the project and we were able to release the first version for public use early the following summer.</p><p>At its base level of functionality, the Weather site displays the historical weather patterns for a selected time range and provides the current weather values so the user can easily see what is happening at the site in real time. The benefits of this are mainly so the user can evaluate the current viewing conditions and know whether or not they are conducive to making <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observations/\">observations</a>.</p><p>The development of these features required substantial planning and architectural considerations concerning the gathering and processing of the data from our Site Environmental Monitoring System (SEMS) and Weather Monitoring System (WMS) sensors. The Weather project is comprised of many lines of back-end code to store the values in a customized database, process the data values for the graphing of raw and derived values, and the graphing code which is written using the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</a> library <a href=\"http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/\">Matplotlib</a>. Each graph image is generated statically and served on the web page. This method increases the simplicity and speed of the site, keeping the graphing decoupled from the front-end user interface.</p><p>The front-end code contains the logic that is able to display the most recent values and explain the meaning of the data to the user. One of the key pieces of information displayed by the site is the enclosure open/closed status. Not only can the users see whether or not the current conditions will allow the dome to open but they can also see historical statistics on when and why the telescope has been closed in the past. This data is further supported with constantly updating live images of the sky at each enclosure site.</p><p>The design of the new site was a collaborative effort. Early on in the year, <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/user/slowe\">Stuart Lowe</a> came to me with a design prototype for the new web page. We worked together to develop the prototype into what would eventually become the interface for this version. The goal was to better integrate the Weather application into the main LCOGT website. This included a complete redesign of the original interface to fit the smaller template and keep with the design themes of the main site. It was important to both Stuart and I that the new design feature, first and foremost, the information on the current status of the enclosures as affected by the current weather conditions at site. Thus, throughout the new design, the values are much more prominent and accessible. As part of the list of new features, the website is now configured to better handle multi-platform mobile devices to ensure the greater potential for access to the website. Thus the display of the information is not constrained by device. The website is built to handle display for those who do not use Javascript, but has some nice functionality for graph selection for the Javascript-enabled browsers. Overall the website is much more robust in the features it offers and more solidly supported.</p><p>The website provides data on the enclosures located at <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/ogg/\">Haleakala</a>, <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/coj/\">Siding Spring</a>, the Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/bpl/\">Back Parking Lot</a>, and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/sqa/\">Sedgwick Reserve</a>. As more telescopes join our network they will too be added to the Weather website. It is a very exciting time here at LCOGT and I think we can all look forward to the new sites that will soon be available to see and view on the weather pages in the months to come.</p><p><img class=\"image-caption media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__1427 img__view_mode__media_large\" id=\"2\" src=\"http://lcogt.net/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/null/weather_new.png\" title=\"A screenshot showing the weather page for our Siding Spring site.\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></p>",

As part of the list of new features, the website is now configured to better handle multi-platform mobile devices to ensure the greater potential for access to the website. Thus the display of the information is not constrained by device. The website is built to handle display for those who do not use Javascript, but has some nice functionality for graph selection for the Javascript-enabled browsers. Overall the website is much more robust in the features it offers and more solidly supported.</p><p>The website provides data on the enclosures located at <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/ogg/\">Haleakala</a>, <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/coj/\">Siding Spring</a>, the Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/bpl/\">Back Parking Lot</a>, and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/weather/sqa/\">Sedgwick Reserve</a>. As more telescopes join our network they will too be added to the Weather website. It is a very exciting time here at LCOGT and I think we can all look forward to the new sites that will soon be available to see and view on the weather pages in the months to come.</p><p><img class=\"image-caption media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__1427 img__view_mode__media_large\" id=\"2\" src=\"http://lcogt.net/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/null/weather_new.png\" title=\"A screenshot showing the weather page for our Siding Spring site.\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></p>",

Because of my HR work, I am in the unique position of knowing everyone here and their basic job. This allows me to see ways we can strategically connect people to work together. It&rsquo;s an amazing part of my job, learning what everybody does. I have a real admiration for what people here are doing and are capable of. I love the part of my job that involves working with people, but I also need quiet time and the accounting side helps balance that by giving me some quiet concentration time.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\">JB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences.</span><br /><span>MS: I grew up on a farm and was always kind of a tomboy, gaining a real connection with nature. My family moved to Santa Barbara in the early 1960&rsquo;s. I went to UCSB and started off as a French major, thinking that I would become an interpreter and live in France. I changed from that direction when I decided to get married in my second year of college, taking time off of school and working before returning to finish UCSB as an Environmental Studies major, then a new program and more aligned with my passion for the environmental movement. My work with numbers and accounting began during this period because I supplemented my income with part-time bookkeeping jobs, later using the flexibility to enable me to prioritize raising my two sons. I eventually built this into a business that specialized in small business consulting, helping build financial systems that paralleled the story of a business. This, of course, brought me to Wayne and Dorothy as clients and then to the transition of my business to my son, leaving me free to join LCOGT in its infancy - a new child to raise! Being a mother to my sons has been and continues to be the most important job of my life with my husband, Duffy and LCOGT coming in close behind.</span><br /><br /><span>I love sports. If I had started earlier, I think I would have wanted to be a professional soccer player! I think that, especially for women, learning to compete in a healthy way carries over into every aspect of life, especially the workplace.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\">JB: What is a typical day at work like?</span><br /><span>MS: My days are all pretty varied and I like it that way. In the morning I usually check email right away in case there are any HR or accounting urgent matters. Each day there are accounting tasks, HR issues, organizational stuff, and I also always have my eye on upcoming tax compliance due dates.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?</span><br /><span>MS: Very few people would say they want to go into admin. It seems to have kind of a bad reputation. You need to be flexible and be able to look at things from a wider perspective than your own. I spend a lot of time working with people to find solutions that are not necessarily their first choice of how to do things, but that help everyone work together and move our organization forward.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\">JB: How does your role impact LCOGT&rsquo;s mission?</span><br /><span>MS: Well, many seem to consider admin a necessary evil, and it&rsquo;s true that unnecessary bureaucracy can usurp its true purpose. In my work here I have really learned to appreciate this purpose staying mindful of trying to help LCOGT grow from the ground up, creating quality infrastructure and procedures. Through this, I&rsquo;ve become more aware of the value of the service that the admin function plays. Wayne made it clear early on that he wanted there to be purpose and rationale behind every procedure. The point is not to create bureaucracy, but to help us all be productive and successful. Walking that line has been a huge challenge. Creating a consciousness of our spending is similar - we all want to do high quality work with high quality products and tools - at the same time, we have to be mindful that we have fixed funding so need to spend wisely. I want to be sure we reach our ultimate mission with the money we have to spend.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\">JB: Thanks Maida!</span></p>",

I helped make <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a> and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/virtualsky/\">Virtual Sky</a> (which, along with <a href=\"http://www.chromoscope.net/\">Chromoscope</a>, are my attempts to start making the astrometrics lab from Star Trek). I helped with <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/siab/\">Star In A Box</a>, adding some features, remodeling here and there. I&rsquo;m also contributing to the coding for the public observing interface that will be used once our network comes online. I actually think of these things as hand-made, kind of like a craft. I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t think of things on the web this way, but I think it&rsquo;s the same kind of crafting process where you make something, then whittle it down, work on it some more, and polish it until you&rsquo;re happy with it.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences. </i><br />SL: I grew up in a city and never had a telescope. As a child I was interested in space and watched Star Trek, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw\">Doctor Who</a> and things like that. In secondary school I thought I wanted to be an architect, but then I realized I was spending a lot of time in school chatting with a friend about the Universe. I hadn&#39;t realized until then that it was something you could study at university. I applied, and was accepted, to a degree program in physics with astrophysics at the <a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/\">University of Manchester</a>. After that I did my PhD in radio astronomy at <a href=\"http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/\">Jodrell Bank Observatory</a>. My PhD work was mostly using <a href=\"http://www.astro.uni.torun.pl/?lang=en\">a radio telescope in Poland</a>. After my PhD I did a post-doc working on ESA&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/planck\">Planck satellite</a> where I helped build and test instruments both before launch, and afterwards while it was on its way to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L2_point\">L2</a>. It is great to be able to say that things I&rsquo;ve handled are now 1 million miles away from the Earth.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What led you to the career/job you are doing now?</i><br />SL: It was a series of fortunate events. I wasn&rsquo;t one of those people who knew from an young age that I wanted to be an astronomer - I just keep following my interests.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What is a typical day at work like? </i><br />SL: I cycle into work at <a href=\"http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/\">Cardiff University</a> and then spend some time catching up on emails from the previous night. That&rsquo;s one of the things about working with an organization with lots of people in other time zones. I spend my day writing computer code, editing the LCOGT website, coming up with new ideas, learning new skills, and looking for inspiration of cutting edge web technology and thinking about how to adapt it to astronomy. One of the reasons I wrote <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/virtualsky/\">Virtual Sky</a> was because I wanted to learn <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\">HTML5</a>. There are also a couple of tea breaks each day (I&rsquo;m British after all) and some time spent chatting with my office mates, which is where some great ideas come from actually.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? </i><br />SL: Do things you are interested in. Don&rsquo;t necessarily believe that how others think you should proceed is going to be the right way for you, and don&rsquo;t stay in a job if you aren&rsquo;t interested in what you&rsquo;re doing. Also, things are often more flexible than they appear. For example, I recently spoke with a secondary school student who wanted to study astronomy, but was worried they might not get accepted to university because they weren&rsquo;t taking physics as part of their A-levels (UK exams at age 16-18). I encouraged them to speak with someone at the university and apply anyway, because there can be more flexibility than it might appear especially if you have good mathematical skills. Persevering at mathematics is important as it gives you a great foundation for many physics-related jobs.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Do you have any hobbies?</i><br />SL: Well, I used to do a lot of mountaineering, but where I live now is quite far from the mountains. However, I&rsquo;m much closer to the sea now so I recently started learning to sail. A lot of my spare time I spend doing web stuff, for example I built Chromoscope in my spare time while I was working with Planck.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Thanks Stuart!</i></p><p>See previous interviews:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-maida-smith\">Maida Smith: </a><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-maida-smith\">Finance and administrative director</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-abiy-tekola\">Abiy Tekola: </a><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-abiy-tekola\">Research astronomer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-mike-falarski\">Mike Falarski: Vice-president in charge of operations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-martin-dominik\">Martin Dominik: Astronomer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-ben-burleson\">Ben Burleson: Computer Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-avi-shporer\">Avi Shporer: Post-doctoral fellow</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-john-hygelund\">John Hygelund: Mechanical Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-yiannis-tsapras\">Yiannis Tsapras: Research Astronomer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-matt-dubberley\">Matt Dubberley: Mechanical Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-rachel-haynes\">Rachel Haynes: Optical Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-federica-bianco\">Federica Bianco: Post-doctoral fellow</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-edward-gomez\">Edward Gomez: Education Director</a></li></ul>",

Observatories across the state were invited to participate in the event located at Prince Kuhio shopping center in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilo,_Hawaii\">Hilo</a>, including LCOGT. JD Armstrong and Rachel Ross attended along with Heather Kaluna and Marco Micheli, grad students from <a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/\">University of Hawai&#39;i</a> Manoa.</p><p>While we are still waiting for the final numbers of attendees, families came through in mass throughout the day. We had three hands-on activities at the LCOGT booth that ranged to accommodate all ages, and if they completed one of the activities they received the LCOGT stamp featuring the Faulkes Telescope North in their passport. Each booth had their own stamp; a passport with a stamp from each booth could be redeemed for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea\">Mauna Kea</a> collectible coin.&nbsp; LCOGT stickers were also given as prizes for completing an activity.</p><p>The three activities included completing <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/book/what-photometry\">photometry</a> measurements on at least one image on <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a>, hunting for an asteroid using data from <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">FTN</a>, and playing <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/activity/play-bingo-charles-messier\">Messier Bingo</a> where the game kept going until everyone won (although we couldn&#39;t decide if the winner getting three in a row should yell &#39;telescope&#39; or &#39;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jdarmstrong/lcogt-hit-astroday\">biscuits</a>&#39;).

Observatories across the state were invited to participate in the event located at Prince Kuhio shopping center in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilo,_Hawaii\">Hilo</a>, including LCOGT. JD Armstrong and Rachel Ross attended along with Heather Kaluna and Marco Micheli, grad students from <a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/\">University of Hawai&#39;i</a> Manoa.</p><p>While we are still waiting for the final numbers of attendees, families came through in mass throughout the day. We had three hands-on activities at the LCOGT booth that ranged to accommodate all ages, and if they completed one of the activities they received the LCOGT stamp featuring the Faulkes Telescope North in their passport. Each booth had their own stamp; a passport with a stamp from each booth could be redeemed for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea\">Mauna Kea</a> collectible coin.&nbsp; LCOGT stickers were also given as prizes for completing an activity.</p><p>The three activities included completing <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/book/what-photometry\">photometry</a> measurements on at least one image on <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a>, hunting for an asteroid using data from <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\">FTN</a>, and playing <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/activity/play-bingo-charles-messier\">Messier Bingo</a> where the game kept going until everyone won (although we couldn&#39;t decide if the winner getting three in a row should yell &#39;telescope&#39; or &#39;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jdarmstrong/lcogt-hit-astroday\">biscuits</a>&#39;).

I did two years&nbsp;of junior college in Wyoming and then came to California. I&rsquo;ve worked for many&nbsp;places over the years including telephone companies and a CNC company. CNC&nbsp;refers to Computer Numeric Controlled which is anything automated moving&nbsp;under computer control of a motor and using feedback. That&rsquo;s what we call a&nbsp;servo loop. I work a lot with control systems. They live in an&nbsp;electrical panel between the computer controller and the&nbsp;telescopes. They&rsquo;re really interesting because they integrate the&nbsp;electronics with the physical,&nbsp;real-world instruments.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What led you to the career or job you are doing now?</i><br />DM:&nbsp;On&nbsp;my last job before coming to LCOGT, I was in an electronics store and there&nbsp;was an ad for this job taped to the counter. The ad looked so old and worn by&nbsp;the time I noticed it, I was sure the position would have been filled already,&nbsp;but I called and they asked me to come in for an interview. It turned out be a&nbsp;natural fit for what I&rsquo;m interested in and my experience.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What is a typical day at work like?</i><br />DM:&nbsp;I come in and get a good cup of coffee then take care of email. I spend a lot of&nbsp;time solving one of two types of problems. Sometimes we have equipment we know&nbsp;we want to use, and we have to figure out how to wire it up. Other times we know&nbsp;what we want to do, but we don&rsquo;t know what equipment we need so we have&nbsp;to research that. I do a lot of design work and&nbsp;maintaining manufacturing documentation. I actually get to build prototypes&nbsp;and things we are only making small quantities of, like <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/rross/floyds-first-light\">FLOyDS</a>. We&rsquo;re only making three of them so we are&nbsp;doing them all in-house. My work is a nice mix of desk work, machine shop, and&nbsp;electronics work. One of the great challenges is when we come up with an idea,&nbsp;we actually have to design and make what we want. We can&rsquo;t just go down to a&nbsp;local telescope parts store!<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?</i><br />DM: All that stuff you&rsquo;re learning in school and wondering if you will ever use it? You&rsquo;ll use it. In fact I think that a lot of the physics behind what we do is as interesting as looking through telescopes. My other advice would be to finish college. There&rsquo;s a lot you can do with a junior college degree, but there&rsquo;s more with a bachelors.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Do you have any hobbies?</i><br />DM:&nbsp;I have a lot of hobbies - maybe too many! I like mountain biking, scuba diving,&nbsp;fishing, camping. And that&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s so great about not only&nbsp;this company, but this location. It&rsquo;s all right here. Almost every day, we have &nbsp;to ask - why do we have to work in this beautiful weather? (A: So we can live in&nbsp;this beautiful place!!!) It&rsquo;s very different from where I grew&nbsp;up in Wyoming; sometimes we would get two months when it never got warmer&nbsp;than 0 degrees Fahrenheit, in the daytime!<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Thanks Dave!</i></p><p>See previous interviews:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-stuart-lowe\">Stuart Lowe: </a><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-stuart-lowe\">Astronomy web developer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-maida-smith\">Maida Smith: </a><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-maida-smith\">Finance and administrative director</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-abiy-tekola\">Abiy Tekola: </a><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-abiy-tekola\">Research astronomer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-mike-falarski\">Mike Falarski: Vice-president in charge of operations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-martin-dominik\">Martin Dominik: Astronomer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-ben-burleson\">Ben Burleson: Computer Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-avi-shporer\">Avi Shporer: Post-doctoral fellow</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-john-hygelund\">John Hygelund: Mechanical Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-yiannis-tsapras\">Yiannis Tsapras: Research Astronomer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-matt-dubberley\">Matt Dubberley: Mechanical Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-rachel-haynes\">Rachel Haynes: Optical Engineer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-federica-bianco\">Federica Bianco: Post-doctoral fellow</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/jbarton/interview-edward-gomez\">Edward Gomez: Education Director</a></li></ul>",

There were four held at <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/site/sedgwick\">Sedgwick</a> and one at Photon Ranch (up in the hills above Santa Barbara). Thank you to everyone who helped plan and attended these events. All the events turned out fantastic even those that didn&#39;t quite have cooperating weather or equipment.</p><p>Photon Ranch &ndash; 5/11:&nbsp; This was a donation made to the <a href=\"http://theoakspcw.org/\">Oaks</a> preschool in Santa Barbara and raffled in their fundraiser. The group was about 15 people and included several young children. Everyone was very excited to be able to look through the telescopes (as well as the yummy star cookies and hot cocoa), but unfortunately the weather was not cooperating. In the occasional holes in the sky, a bright star or Mars was centered in the telescopes (a 20&rdquo; reflector and an 8&rdquo; Maksutov) and constellations were pointed out. Several of the young attendees participated in a Q&amp;A session as well as telling stories about the sky in between the gaps in the clouds. As it usually works when trying to work around weather, as soon as the group left the skies cleared. Even though the group wasn&#39;t able to see much of the sky, they still seemed to be pretty enthusiastic about learning more about astronomy and seeing some of it with their own eyes. LCOGT attendees included Wayne Rosing, Maida Smith, and Rachel Ross.</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 5/18:&nbsp; The star party was donated to the <a href=\"http://http://www.centralcoastsalmon.com/\">Central Coast Salmon Enhancement</a>. There were about 10 attendees of the quite varied group which enjoyed a catered appetizer dinner at Sedgwick&#39;s Tipton house before heading up to the observatory for desserts, coffee, and sky gazing. The weather was cold, the skies were clear, and the group was able to observe many objects through the telescopes (including <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/partner-telescopes/sedgwick-reserve-observatory\">BOS</a> and an <a href=\"http://www.astro-physics.com/\">AP</a> 178 refractor) including Mars, Saturn, and a few globular clusters and galaxies as well as learn a few constellations and stars across the sky. The entire group was very excited and seemed to thoroughly enjoy learning about the night sky and looking through the telescopes. LCOGT attendees included Wayne Rosing, Kurt Vander Horst, and Rachel Ross.</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 5/25:&nbsp; Other than star gazing, another fun nighttime activity at Sedgwick is camping, which is what a group of 8<sup>th</sup> graders from Carpenteria were doing in addition to full days worth of activities (including star gazing) around the reserve. This event had already been rescheduled once due to bad weather, and unfortunately the weather did not want to cooperate again. But in the breaks between the heavy clouds and before a few water droplets fell from the sky, the group of about 30 were treated to Mars, Saturn, and the waxing crescent Moon through BOS, the AP 178, and an 11&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.celestron.com\">Celestron</a>. Despite the weather, the group was great in asking a lot of very good questions and very much enjoying the few objects that they were able to see (especially the rings of Saturn). LCOGT attendees included BJ Fulton, Kurt Vander Horst, and Rachel Ross.</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 5/30:&nbsp; A physics class from UCSB had a star party near the end of their quarter. Unfortunately sky conditions weren&#39;t great due to a bright moon and awful seeing. Even so, we tried to observe many objects with BOS and the AP 178 including Mars, Saturn, the Moon, a few binary stars and globular clusters, and tried for a few galaxies and nebulae even though most were washed out due to the Moon and the bad seeing. The group was great even given the not-so-ideal conditions, and one of the coolest things that the class was discussing on the way back from Sedgwick was the fact that they got a good demonstration of what &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; is, because they had only just heard about it. LCOGT attendees included Tim Brown, Rachel Street, and Rachel Ross</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 6/7:&nbsp; A second physics class was able to make it up to Sedgwick for a star party, as well as having a tour of LCOGT two days earlier (with a few of the students staying a bit longer to watch the start of the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/transitofvenus\">transit of Venus</a>). This class had been using BOS in their class to get data for individual projects throughout the quarter. The sky was good, clear, and dark and we used BOS and an 11&rdquo; Celestron (which was controlled by the students taking turns to get some hands-on experience) to view many objects including Mars, Saturn, several galaxies and globular clusters, a couple planetary nebulae and binary stars, as well as an open cluster at the very end of the night including learning some stars and constellations in between looking through the telescopes. BOS was being a bit finicky between each slew to a new object causing some delays but even so the night turned out to be quite successful and the group was great in asking a lot of questions and enjoying seeing objects through the telescope they had been previously been using robotically through a calender. LCOGT attendees included Rachel Ross.</p><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1506\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image image-caption='UCSB physics class looking through the AP 178\\\"\",\"id\":\"3\",\"title\":\"UCSB Physics class looking through the AP 178\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><em>(UCSB physics class from 5/30 looking through the AP 178 with Tim explaining what they are seeing.)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1507\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image\",\"id\":\"3\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><em>(Kurt looking through the AP 178, with BOS in the background, at the waxing crescent Moon.)</em></p>",

In the occasional holes in the sky, a bright star or Mars was centered in the telescopes (a 20&rdquo; reflector and an 8&rdquo; Maksutov) and constellations were pointed out. Several of the young attendees participated in a Q&amp;A session as well as telling stories about the sky in between the gaps in the clouds. As it usually works when trying to work around weather, as soon as the group left the skies cleared. Even though the group wasn&#39;t able to see much of the sky, they still seemed to be pretty enthusiastic about learning more about astronomy and seeing some of it with their own eyes. LCOGT attendees included Wayne Rosing, Maida Smith, and Rachel Ross.</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 5/18:&nbsp; The star party was donated to the <a href=\"http://http://www.centralcoastsalmon.com/\">Central Coast Salmon Enhancement</a>. There were about 10 attendees of the quite varied group which enjoyed a catered appetizer dinner at Sedgwick&#39;s Tipton house before heading up to the observatory for desserts, coffee, and sky gazing. The weather was cold, the skies were clear, and the group was able to observe many objects through the telescopes (including <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/partner-telescopes/sedgwick-reserve-observatory\">BOS</a> and an <a href=\"http://www.astro-physics.com/\">AP</a> 178 refractor) including Mars, Saturn, and a few globular clusters and galaxies as well as learn a few constellations and stars across the sky. The entire group was very excited and seemed to thoroughly enjoy learning about the night sky and looking through the telescopes. LCOGT attendees included Wayne Rosing, Kurt Vander Horst, and Rachel Ross.</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 5/25:&nbsp; Other than star gazing, another fun nighttime activity at Sedgwick is camping, which is what a group of 8<sup>th</sup> graders from Carpenteria were doing in addition to full days worth of activities (including star gazing) around the reserve. This event had already been rescheduled once due to bad weather, and unfortunately the weather did not want to cooperate again. But in the breaks between the heavy clouds and before a few water droplets fell from the sky, the group of about 30 were treated to Mars, Saturn, and the waxing crescent Moon through BOS, the AP 178, and an 11&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.celestron.com\">Celestron</a>. Despite the weather, the group was great in asking a lot of very good questions and very much enjoying the few objects that they were able to see (especially the rings of Saturn). LCOGT attendees included BJ Fulton, Kurt Vander Horst, and Rachel Ross.</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 5/30:&nbsp; A physics class from UCSB had a star party near the end of their quarter. Unfortunately sky conditions weren&#39;t great due to a bright moon and awful seeing. Even so, we tried to observe many objects with BOS and the AP 178 including Mars, Saturn, the Moon, a few binary stars and globular clusters, and tried for a few galaxies and nebulae even though most were washed out due to the Moon and the bad seeing. The group was great even given the not-so-ideal conditions, and one of the coolest things that the class was discussing on the way back from Sedgwick was the fact that they got a good demonstration of what &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; is, because they had only just heard about it. LCOGT attendees included Tim Brown, Rachel Street, and Rachel Ross</p><p>Sedgwick &ndash; 6/7:&nbsp; A second physics class was able to make it up to Sedgwick for a star party, as well as having a tour of LCOGT two days earlier (with a few of the students staying a bit longer to watch the start of the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/transitofvenus\">transit of Venus</a>). This class had been using BOS in their class to get data for individual projects throughout the quarter. The sky was good, clear, and dark and we used BOS and an 11&rdquo; Celestron (which was controlled by the students taking turns to get some hands-on experience) to view many objects including Mars, Saturn, several galaxies and globular clusters, a couple planetary nebulae and binary stars, as well as an open cluster at the very end of the night including learning some stars and constellations in between looking through the telescopes. BOS was being a bit finicky between each slew to a new object causing some delays but even so the night turned out to be quite successful and the group was great in asking a lot of questions and enjoying seeing objects through the telescope they had been previously been using robotically through a calender. LCOGT attendees included Rachel Ross.</p><p><span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/media/photo%282%29_0.JPG?itok=rS4qbM9o\" alt=\"\" title=\"UCSB Physics class looking through the AP 178\" /></span></p><p><em>(UCSB physics class from 5/30 looking through the AP 178 with Tim explaining what they are seeing.)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/media/photo%283%29.JPG?itok=W6zAyGkD\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span></p><p><em>(Kurt looking through the AP 178, with BOS in the background, at the waxing crescent Moon.)</em></p>",

Organised by the Cape Town Science centre, <a href=\"http://ww.saao.ac.za\">SAAO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net\">LCOGT</a>, the event created to participants an opportunity to develop and expand their understanding about our and other solar systems in the Universe.</p><p class=\"p2\">The Cape Town science centre conducted a tour of the night sky as well as other interesting activities through their mobile planetarium in three sessiones in each town and the learners are exited about it. In the afternoon of each day, teachers workshop focused on our solar system was conducted. During the evening, the students and their teachers enjoyed observing the beautiful dark sky of the karoo using Dobsonian telescopes from SAAO. Saturn, Mars and Venus together with some star clusters were among the objects observed in the nights and most of the students got a chance to look these objects through telescope for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">The most interesting part of the visit was the participation of some of the students in the <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net\">LCOGT</a> web based <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net/education/agentexoplanet\">Agent-Exoplanet citizen science project</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net/education/starinabox\">star in a box activity</a>. The event happened in the Sutherland community centre (supported by SAAO) internet connected computer facility. In this activity about 30 grade eight students in two groups from Roggeveld primary school participated. The students learned all the steps they need to measure the brightness of the host star of the exoplanet taken at different time and produce the light curve which ultimately, together with contributions from others, help astronomers at LCOGT characterize the physical properties of the different exoplanets in the project better.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">A follow up activity with the same group of students on the Agent Exoplanet project was also conducted this week (June 11 and 12, 2012). Apart from developing their knowledge about exoplanet and exposing to real data analysis of astronomy, the project created a good opportunity to develop the computer skills of the students. In order to mark the event, the participants were given mugs with LCOGT and SAAO logos. This type of public engagement will continue in the future in a more organised and expanded manner in order to include even more participants both in the Sutherland and Cape Town area. I would like to thank the Cape Town Science Center and the SAAO education stuffs based in Sutherland (especially Mr. Karel Klein) for making this event happen!</p>",

Organised by the Cape Town Science centre, <a href=\"http://ww.saao.ac.za\">SAAO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net\">LCOGT</a>, the event created to participants an opportunity to develop and expand their understanding about our and other solar systems in the Universe.</p><p class=\"p2\">The Cape Town science centre conducted a tour of the night sky as well as other interesting activities through their mobile planetarium in three sessiones in each town and the learners are exited about it. In the afternoon of each day, teachers workshop focused on our solar system was conducted. During the evening, the students and their teachers enjoyed observing the beautiful dark sky of the karoo using Dobsonian telescopes from SAAO. Saturn, Mars and Venus together with some star clusters were among the objects observed in the nights and most of the students got a chance to look these objects through telescope for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">The most interesting part of the visit was the participation of some of the students in the <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net\">LCOGT</a> web based <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net/education/agentexoplanet\">Agent-Exoplanet citizen science project</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net/education/starinabox\">star in a box activity</a>. The event happened in the Sutherland community centre (supported by SAAO) internet connected computer facility. In this activity about 30 grade eight students in two groups from Roggeveld primary school participated. The students learned all the steps they need to measure the brightness of the host star of the exoplanet taken at different time and produce the light curve which ultimately, together with contributions from others, help astronomers at LCOGT characterize the physical properties of the different exoplanets in the project better.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p2\">A follow up activity with the same group of students on the Agent Exoplanet project was also conducted this week (June 11 and 12, 2012). Apart from developing their knowledge about exoplanet and exposing to real data analysis of astronomy, the project created a good opportunity to develop the computer skills of the students. In order to mark the event, the participants were given mugs with LCOGT and SAAO logos. This type of public engagement will continue in the future in a more organised and expanded manner in order to include even more participants both in the Sutherland and Cape Town area. I would like to thank the Cape Town Science Center and the SAAO education stuffs based in Sutherland (especially Mr. Karel Klein) for making this event happen!</p>",

I&rsquo;ve spent most of my adult life at university and have three degrees as a result - a combined undergraduate and masters degree in physics, another masters in high performance computing where I learned how to write code for supercomputers, and then my PhD in astronomy.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: So is the cluster we have here at LCOGT considered a supercomputer?</i><br />ES: It could be used in that way, but most of what we do with it is not really supercomputing. The difference is in the nature of the processes you run. For example, if you have a to-do list with five jobs on it, if you could ask five friends to each take one of the jobs, you could potentially get the list finished five times faster than if you did one task after another by yourself. The friends split up, and go and run their errands. That&rsquo;s the kind of computing that tends to get done on the cluster. Astronomers will often have multiple instances of a program running on several different <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPUs</a>, but each one is dealing with a different data set or set of initial conditions, and don&rsquo;t need to communicate. This is called &ldquo;trivial parallelism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;task farming&rdquo;.<br /><br />Real supercomputing is when the tasks can&rsquo;t be done independently because they depend on one other. For example, when you&rsquo;re modeling something like the weather, you might have a map of a certain area and divide it into a grid. You can run calculations on each square of the grid, but the edges of the grid squares influence each other (clouds don&rsquo;t know about your grid!), so it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated than task farming, because each process must communicate with others, running on other CPUs, all the time, to stay in sync and access the data they need.<br /><br />We may eventually use the cluster to solve computationally-intensive aspects of the scheduling problem that would otherwise be intractable, but so far, that hasn&rsquo;t been necessary.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What led you to the career or job you are doing now?</i><br />ES: A great deal of luck! Although I have been interested in astronomy since I was young. We had a fascinating book lying around the house, &ldquo;The Atlas of the Universe&rdquo;, by Patrick Moore, which made a huge impression on me. Recently, on a trip back in England, I was looking at a piece of work from when I was seven years old. I had written a story about a boy flying to a globular cluster on a rocketship. So I guess I&rsquo;ve been interested in astronomy for a long time...<br /><br />At university, I decided to study physics after reading about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein\">Einstein</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman\">Feynman</a>, and digesting too many popular science books. In my final year I worked on data from a project that was modeling dark matter evolution with supercomputers, which was cool. Inspired by that, I was very lucky, and secured a scholarship to go to Edinburgh to study high performance computing. After that, I decided I wanted to do research in artificial intelligence at PhD level. While researching options, I found a PhD opening on the <a href=\"http://www.estar.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">eStar project</a>, which involved both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">AI</a> and controlling robotic telescopes. My background in both physics and computing served me well, and I got the position.<br /><br />Two years into my PhD I gave a talk at a conference about my dissertation topic, which in a nutshell was about all the clever things one could achieve with networked robotic telescopes. I had prototyped some of my ideas, but a lot of it was theoretical at that time. However, a few people from LCOGT were in attendance, and afterwards they suggested I might be a good fit for LCOGT. And now here I am! I feel extremely lucky because my dissertation work was an incredibly niche topic, yet I have the opportunity to build on some of the ideas from my work, and make it happen. LCOGT&rsquo;s network is a once-in-a-lifetime project, and it&rsquo;s a real privilege to be able to make this stuff real.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: So what can the scheduler do now?</i><br />ES: Right now it&rsquo;s still in the prototype phase. One way to imagine it is like an onion, with a kernel at the core, and many layers wrapped around that. The various kinds of astronomical requests come in at the surface of the onion, are combined with what we understand about the state of the network, and then are translated and successively refined, until they can be expressed in the language of the scheduler, and reach the kernel. The kernel operates in an abstract mathematical space. It takes the requests, and decides how to arrange them to construct a solution. Then we translate back from our computer science problem into the real world, and use the solution to produce a real schedule, with observations to be placed at different telescopes.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of requests, from simple one-time observations to complex time-series requests, such as the observation of a target to be made five times, with three hours between each observation. The scheduler has to take into account when and from where each object is visible, where the observing conditions are met, and then figure out the best way to schedule the observations. In addition, each request has a priority given to it by the Time Allocation Committee (TAC), which influences our decisions. And all of this needs to be recalculated, often, because conditions are always changing, and things don&rsquo;t go as expected. In a way, you could say the job of the scheduler is to choose who loses, because somebody always will!<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What is a typical day at work like?</i><br />ES: I spend some time keeping up on software team issues and discussions, often trying to clarify what we are doing. I also check in on the other projects I am involved in. When not in meetings, I spend the rest of the time writing and testing code, and lying on the floor thinking (a bad habit I picked up from my PhD supervisor, <a href=\"http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/\">Tim Naylor</a>).<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?</i><br />ES: Don&rsquo;t go into it unless you find it fascinating because it&rsquo;s really hard! You could make more money doing something else. But if you truly find it interesting, it&rsquo;s a great way to make a unique contribution to the world.<br /><br />You will never be able to stop learning. Understand how much you don&rsquo;t know, and learn some more! People often think what you&rsquo;re doing is a kind of black magic. Don&rsquo;t expect external appreciation. You need internal motivation to find a career like this fulfilling.<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: What do you do in your spare time?</i><br />ES: Excitingly, I actually do some programming in my spare time! Right now I&rsquo;m learning an unusual programming language called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)\">Haskell</a>. I like to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible. I also like to play piano, ride my bike, read a lot, and have drunken conversations about philosophy. I&rsquo;m reading a lot about anatomy at the moment, which is fascinating.<br /><br />I also play a lot of board games, many pretty obscure, but including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess\">chess</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)\">go</a>. Anyone want a game?<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Thanks Eric!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Right now I&rsquo;m learning an unusual programming language called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)\">Haskell</a>. I like to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible. I also like to play piano, ride my bike, read a lot, and have drunken conversations about philosophy. I&rsquo;m reading a lot about anatomy at the moment, which is fascinating.<br /><br />I also play a lot of board games, many pretty obscure, but including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess\">chess</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)\">go</a>. Anyone want a game?<br /><br /><i style=\"color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\">JB: Thanks Eric!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

As it would turn out, I found Python really fun. It was definitely cool getting a different insight into how computers work and the many things one could do with them.

I spent a lot of time doing video editing during school and was eventually tempted to learn Adobe After Effects. Some of the graphics are actually drawn using their coding language and I was curious to learn more about how that works so I took some programming classes. As it would turn out, I found Python really fun. It was definitely cool getting a different insight into how computers work and the many things one could do with them.

I went to Boston University for my undergraduate degree which was a B.A. in astronomy and physics. I did my Masters and PhD at Ohio State University. Apart from a job at Sizzler in high school, all of my jobs have been research related. During undergrad, I worked with my advisor to build a spectrograph called <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/prism/\">PRISM</a> which is a different type of spectrograph from the ones we are building here. In Ohio I had TA and research assistant positions.<br /><br />Besides astronomy, I&rsquo;m also interested in astrophotography, rock climbing, and road biking.<br /><br /><b style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What led you to the career or job you are doing now?</span></b><br />JE: I&rsquo;ve always been interested in the origins of Earth and humanity. When I started my undergraduate degree, I wanted to do a double major in theology and cosmology. It turned out that between astronomy and physics, my schedule for four years didn&rsquo;t leave room for many theology classes, but that was ok with me because I was more satisfied with the scientific theories of the origin of the universe anyway.<br /><br />My dad was also always interested in astronomy, and I remember one time when I was a kid, my dad had a little telescope set up in the back yard pointed at the moon. I looked at it, then looked away for a few minutes and when I looked through the telescope again, the Earth had moved and the moon was no longer visible. I was sure my dad had moved the telescope and it took him awhile to convince me that it was the Earth&rsquo;s rotation that had caused the moon to move out of the field of view.<br /><br /><b style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What is a typical day at work like?</span></b><br />JE: &nbsp;I do a lot of computer programming and processing and analyzing data.

Pay attention in your science and math classes, and also in English class. You can be the most brilliant scientist in the world, but if you can&rsquo;t communicate clearly in writing, no one will ever know what you are doing.<br /><br /><b style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What attracted you to LCOGT?</span></b><br />JE: I liked LCOGT&rsquo;s focus on time domain astronomy and small telescopes. In astronomy there is often this temptation that bigger is better, and to keep building bigger and bigger telescopes. But with smaller telescopes you can automate and get more data with less effort. My PhD thesis was about roboticizing a 0.5 meter telescope, so this opportunity with LCOGT was a perfect fit for my interests in robotic telescopes, exoplanets, and building instruments.<br /><br /><b style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: So what do you think of the news about the Higgs boson?</span></b><br />JE: I was actually a bit disappointed. I had been hoping that something was going to be discovered that would show clearly that the standard model is wrong and that we would have to rethink everything. I&rsquo;ve never been all that satisfied with the the need for dark matter and dark energy. It seems like we just really don&rsquo;t understand gravity very well. But with the Higgs boson now, it seems like the evidence is saying we are actually pretty close to the standard model.<br /><br /><b style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: Thanks Jason!</span></b></p>",

This distinction is necessary because the observation types differ with respect to the mechanism by which observations are scheduled, and the expected cost in telescope resource per hour of on-sky time.<br /><br />If you desire fixed-block time, <strong>do not</strong> pad your request to allow for possible bad weather; &nbsp;ask for what your science requires. &nbsp;The TAC will take weather into account (up to a factor of 2 padding) without your asking. &nbsp;If, however, such padding does not make sense (perhaps you wish to observe a once-in-a-century event, for which repeat observing is not possible), then please put a statement to this effect in the body of your proposal.<br /><br />If the TAC awards you fixed-block observing time for your science you will be allocated an LCOGT liaison astronomer. Please coordinate the scheduling and the particulars of your observing requirements directly with them. &nbsp;Give as much advance warning as possible so we can resolve any conflicting programs, but at least 3-5 weeks (the schedule is usually done in 2-week blocks, with requests due 3 weeks before the start of the block).</p><h2>Time charging policy</h2><p>The rules for how time is deducted from a user&#39;s observing program based on the observation type are as follows:</p><h3>Fixed-block Observations</h3><ul><li>For every fixed-block observation scheduled to be observed, an equal amount of time is deducted from the total available to that program in the semester, regardless of the quality of the data collected or whether any data were collected at all.</li><li>Programs may release a requested block (by contacting your LCOGT liaison) up to 7 days prior to the date of the scheduled observation. If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.<ul><li>This policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Queue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)</h3><ul><li>These observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.</li><li>Queue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are<br />attempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality.

Over the course of the weekend we saw a couple of hundred people which is a great beginning for a science festival run on a shoe-string, and hopefully will give us all the energy to do more ambitious things next year. On the Sunday evening I volunteered to do a 9 minute &quot;<a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\">Science show-off</a>&quot; where 10 professional scientists took 9 minutes to show off about a bit of science of our choice in a bar.</p><p>Although its been a busy summer already, the outreach is always rewarding and enjoyable.

Over the course of the weekend we saw a couple of hundred people which is a great beginning for a science festival run on a shoe-string, and hopefully will give us all the energy to do more ambitious things next year. On the Sunday evening I volunteered to do a 9 minute &quot;<a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\">Science show-off</a>&quot; where 10 professional scientists took 9 minutes to show off about a bit of science of our choice in a bar.</p><p>Although its been a busy summer already, the outreach is always rewarding and enjoyable. You get to meet so many interesting people too.</p>",

I am also a member of an IAU task force for children and schools, so it gave me an excellent opportunity to talk to different outreach and education groups within the IAU.

It was my first time speaking through a translator, which was quite a novel experience (I owe a debt of gratitude to the excellent language skills of <a href=\"https://github.com/hao-wang\">Hao Wang</a>).</p><p><span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/people/beijing-short-74.JPG?itok=A7rm0xWs\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span><br /><br />One thing I will not miss about Beijing is the smog. On a few days it was so thick it penetrated the conference centre and was clearly visible in the halls and lecture theatres. I also won&#39;t miss the deep-fried spiders (which could be found on many &#39;street meat&#39; stalls).</p>",

That&rsquo;s the Wide Angle Search for Planets.

It amazed me because they weren&rsquo;t science fiction, they were real! My parents took me to a local amateur astronomical society and I also tried to do astrophotography from my backyard. There was a lot of light pollution where I lived though, and this was in the days of film cameras. My attempts were not very successful! &nbsp;But I loved every second of it. </span><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">I watched the Galilean Moons orbiting Jupiter through a small refractor from my bedroom window, night after night. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What is a typical day at work like?</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">RS: It&rsquo;s really varied and it&rsquo;s difficult to get into a routine. For example this morning I met with Dave Sand who is an instrument scientist, and had a driving lesson from him on how to use the </span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/rross/floyds-first-light\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">spectrograph</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> he&rsquo;s developed. There&rsquo;s an exciting microlensing event going on right now, so my day will be planned around taking observations. I have to make sure I&rsquo;m finished with my lunch by 1pm so I can start observing on the Liverpool Telescope. Then I&rsquo;ll work my weekend around observing time on </span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">FTN</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> because we want to get some spectroscopy observations of this target.

You should also get involved with an amateur astronomical society. Many amateur astronomers are so knowledgeable that the only difference between them and professionals is that they don&rsquo;t get paid. They can really inspire your interest and help you get started.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What do you wish you had known about being an astronomer?</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">RS: There are a lot of pressures in this career and it can be quite stressful. Professional science is extremely competitive and can be very intense. You are under constant pressure to research and publish and most work contracts are very short term until you get tenure. The hours are extremely irregular, which can be positive and negative. You get to travel a lot, and meet and work with people from all over the world. I hadn&rsquo;t realized that about this career but it&rsquo;s been very rewarding and fun.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: Is the search for life what interests you about exoplanets? Do you think we will find life on other planets in our life times?</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">RS: Of course the search for life is fascinating and I think we will discover life somewhere else in our galaxy one day. Whether it will be in our life times I&rsquo;m not sure. We can look for bioindicators on other planets, but it will be difficult to ever be sure that they are caused by life or by something else. Perhaps we will even find evidence of life elsewhere in our solar system first. When I was first getting interested in astronomy, the </span><a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">Voyager mission</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> was just reaching the outer planets and revealing so much more about them and how different they are. Now we know of hundreds more planets throughout the Galaxy. It&rsquo;s really the stunning variety of different planets that interests me. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: Thanks Rachel!</span></b></p>",

That&rsquo;s the Wide Angle Search for Planets. My work with the project involved writing data reduction software and analysing the data. &nbsp;We found our first planets just before my contract ran out! Then I came to </span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">LCOGT</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> where I&rsquo;ve been for the past 6 years.

It amazed me because they weren&rsquo;t science fiction, they were real! My parents took me to a local amateur astronomical society and I also tried to do astrophotography from my backyard. There was a lot of light pollution where I lived though, and this was in the days of film cameras. My attempts were not very successful! &nbsp;But I loved every second of it. </span><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">I watched the Galilean Moons orbiting Jupiter through a small refractor from my bedroom window, night after night. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What is a typical day at work like?</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">RS: It&rsquo;s really varied and it&rsquo;s difficult to get into a routine. For example this morning I met with Dave Sand who is an instrument scientist, and had a driving lesson from him on how to use the </span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/rross/floyds-first-light\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">spectrograph</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> he&rsquo;s developed. There&rsquo;s an exciting microlensing event going on right now, so my day will be planned around taking observations. I have to make sure I&rsquo;m finished with my lunch by 1pm so I can start observing on the Liverpool Telescope. Then I&rsquo;ll work my weekend around observing time on </span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/2m/faulkes-telescope-north\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">FTN</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> because we want to get some spectroscopy observations of this target.

You should also get involved with an amateur astronomical society. Many amateur astronomers are so knowledgeable that the only difference between them and professionals is that they don&rsquo;t get paid. They can really inspire your interest and help you get started.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: What do you wish you had known about being an astronomer?</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">RS: There are a lot of pressures in this career and it can be quite stressful. Professional science is extremely competitive and can be very intense. You are under constant pressure to research and publish and most work contracts are very short term until you get tenure. The hours are extremely irregular, which can be positive and negative. You get to travel a lot, and meet and work with people from all over the world. I hadn&rsquo;t realized that about this career but it&rsquo;s been very rewarding and fun.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: Is the search for life what interests you about exoplanets? Do you think we will find life on other planets in our life times?</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">RS: Of course the search for life is fascinating and I think we will discover life somewhere else in our galaxy one day. Whether it will be in our life times I&rsquo;m not sure. We can look for bioindicators on other planets, but it will be difficult to ever be sure that they are caused by life or by something else. Perhaps we will even find evidence of life elsewhere in our solar system first. When I was first getting interested in astronomy, the </span><a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">Voyager mission</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \"> was just reaching the outer planets and revealing so much more about them and how different they are. Now we know of hundreds more planets throughout the Galaxy. It&rsquo;s really the stunning variety of different planets that interests me. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \">JB: Thanks Rachel!</span></b></p>",

ESSS is the only body working for the development of astronomy in Ethiopia and it is in the process of building an observatory in mount Entoto (altitude of ~3100m) very close to the Capital Addis Ababa. The observatory is expected to operate two 1-meter telescopes capable of doing both high resolution spectroscopy and various types of imaging starting from the middle of 2013.</div><div><br />More than 60 high school physics and mathematics teachers as well as selected astronomy enthusiastic students participated in the event.&nbsp;The event created a remarkable opportunity for the high school teachers to develop their skill on how to develop a curriculum that embraces various relevant astronomy topics for their physics and maths classes. A very useful discussion on the topic was held and the teachers shared their experience among themselves. A basic astronomy lecture including stellar astronomy, solar systems, astronomical coordinate systems and navigational astronomy were presented. This gave participants some background to the different activities done later in the program.<br /><br />Both a presentation and a workshop sessions were conducted about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net\">LCOGT</a>&nbsp;facilities and some of the freely available online activities on LCOGT website. The presentation focused on the commitments of LCOGT to promote public understanding of astronomy. It was emphasised that LCOGT has various activities ranging from planets to solar systems to galaxies ready to be used by the public and participants are highly encouraged to use any of the resources. Finally, one afternoon was dedicated to do the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/starinabox\">Star in a Box</a>&nbsp;activities. &nbsp;Participants learned a lot and were very much happy with the opportunity to engage themselves with real data.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the program was a one hour long live observation done with the 2-meter <a href=\"http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/\">Faulkes Telescope</a>&nbsp;in Hawaii. Various astronomical objects such as galaxies, stellar systems and nebulae were observed. Participants were able to appreciate the different procedures involved in taking observations with robotic telescopes via the internet. They are all very happy with the big opportunity the LCOGT telescopes (especially the 0.4-meter ones) will bring to Africa for public outreach and educational activities once they are operational. This would definitely help in building the momentum for the use of LCOGT robotic telescopes in the continent for public outreach and education.&nbsp;</div>",

The observatory is expected to operate two 1-meter telescopes capable of doing both high resolution spectroscopy and various types of imaging starting from the middle of 2013.</div><div><br />More than 60 high school physics and mathematics teachers as well as selected astronomy enthusiastic students participated in the event.&nbsp;The event created a remarkable opportunity for the high school teachers to develop their skill on how to develop a curriculum that embraces various relevant astronomy topics for their physics and maths classes. A very useful discussion on the topic was held and the teachers shared their experience among themselves. A basic astronomy lecture including stellar astronomy, solar systems, astronomical coordinate systems and navigational astronomy were presented. This gave participants some background to the different activities done later in the program.<br /><br />Both a presentation and a workshop sessions were conducted about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.lcogt.net\">LCOGT</a>&nbsp;facilities and some of the freely available online activities on LCOGT website. The presentation focused on the commitments of LCOGT to promote public understanding of astronomy. It was emphasised that LCOGT has various activities ranging from planets to solar systems to galaxies ready to be used by the public and participants are highly encouraged to use any of the resources. Finally, one afternoon was dedicated to do the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/education/starinabox\">Star in a Box</a>&nbsp;activities. &nbsp;Participants learned a lot and were very much happy with the opportunity to engage themselves with real data.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the program was a one hour long live observation done with the 2-meter <a href=\"http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/\">Faulkes Telescope</a>&nbsp;in Hawaii. Various astronomical objects such as galaxies, stellar systems and nebulae were observed. Participants were able to appreciate the different procedures involved in taking observations with robotic telescopes via the internet. They are all very happy with the big opportunity the LCOGT telescopes (especially the 0.4-meter ones) will bring to Africa for public outreach and educational activities once they are operational. This would definitely help in building the momentum for the use of LCOGT robotic telescopes in the continent for public outreach and education.&nbsp;</div>",

Although this fire is still burning at the time of writing, it appears that the telescopes have survived. FTS itself has lost a cable to its external weather station but otherwise appears to be OK. Needless to say, much work and some repairs will be necessary before it can return to operation. This will probably cause a delay in the engineering work we had planned for late February/early March 2013,&nbsp; including the realuminizing of the primary mirror.&nbsp; At this stage we hope to have FTS back in operation within approximately 1.5 months but we cannot make accurate predictions.&nbsp; Once it does return to operation, we expect to have to close the dome during periods of relatively low wind speeds, to avoid blowing ash entering the dome.&nbsp; FTS may therefore have reduced on-sky time over the course of the 2013A semester.</p><h3>NEW INSTRUMENT: THE FLOYDS LONG-SLIT SPECTROGRAPH</h3><p>Both FTN and FTS have new <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/instrumentation/floyds\">FLOYDS</a> long-slit spectrographs. Both instruments are operational and we are currently completing the integration of them with our robotic control system. For this reason, and due to the additional work currently involved in operating them, a number of additional rules apply:</p><ul><li>A small number of proposals will be accepted for these instruments in 2013A</li><li>All proposals using them will be executed on a shared risk basis.</li><li>All proposals using them are required to have Instrument Scientist <a href=\"mailto:david.sand@ttu.edu\">David Sand</a> directly involved.&nbsp; PIs should contact David in good time before the deadline to check the feasibility of their project.</li></ul><p>See the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/network/instrumentation/floyds\">FLOYDS web page for full instrument description</a>.</p><h3>WHO CAN APPLY FOR TELESCOPE TIME?</h3><p>Eligibility to apply to this call is limited to members of institutions with which LCOGT has formal agreements, and to individuals from other institutions who are principal investigators on an observing projects that have been granted Faulkes Telescope time during the last 2 years. The list of eligible institutions includes LCOGT itself, UCSB, UH, ANU, MacQuarie U., ARI, and the Faulkes Telescope Project. I am sending this to a representative (but not exhaustive) list of people at those institutions. If you are one of these, please pass this message to your interested colleagues. I have tried to make an exhaustive list of eligible individuals from other institutions; if you are getting this email directly from me, you may assume you are on my list and are eligible. If you get this call by other means and think you qualify, then please excuse my oversight, and get in touch.</p><p>To those connected with programs to which we already have made major commitments (e.g. the schools programs, Faulkes Telescope Project, U. Hawaii, ANU, ARI, and Robonet.) I ask that you please submit proposals anyway. &nbsp;In particular, please tell me the fraction of hours that you expect to use for fixed-group observing, for queue-scheduled observing, (flexible and monitor groups), and for ToO observing. &nbsp;I will email each of these groups separately in a few days with the number of hours that they may expect to receive this semester.</p><h3>FORMATING ADVICE</h3><ul><li>We suggest that references be placed within the 2 pages allocated for figures,</li><li>Please use a minimum font size of 11pt throughout the proposal,</li><li>Please see the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/science/article/guidelines-applying-telescope-time\">Guidelines for applying for telescope time</a> for a more comprehensive list.</li></ul><h3>OBSERVING OVERHEADS</h3><p>When estimating the number of exposures required, please factor in the following overheads:</p><ul><li>Spectral/Merope bin 2x2 readout time is ~22sec.</li><li>Filter change time for both cameras is on average ~30s but may be longer if the filters are in different wheels.</li></ul><h3>PROPOSAL PRIORITY</h3><p>Most proposals will be allocated a priority automatically by the TAC. However, we also offer background-priority ranking, which can be selected on the proposal form. Background programs are intended to fill gaps in the schedule when no other program can be done, by providing reservoir of observations which can be executed at any time and (ideally) in any conditions. Please note that only queue-scheduled observations can be made through a background proposal, and no guarantees can be made as to its execution. Nevertheless, background proposals should clearly state the amount of time requested. All other proposals should go through the standard TAC-ranked channel.</p><p>To those connected with programs to which we already have made major commitments (e.g. the schools programs, U.

This distinction is necessary because the observation types differ with respect to the mechanism by which observations are scheduled, and the expected cost in telescope resource per hour of on-sky time.<br /><br />If you desire fixed-block time, <strong>do not</strong> pad your request to allow for possible bad weather; &nbsp;ask for what your science requires. &nbsp;The TAC will take weather into account (up to a factor of 2 padding) without your asking. &nbsp;If, however, such padding does not make sense (perhaps you wish to observe a once-in-a-century event, for which repeat observing is not possible), then please put a statement to this effect in the body of your proposal.<br /><br />If the TAC awards you fixed-block observing time for your science you will be allocated an LCOGT liaison astronomer. Please coordinate the scheduling and the particulars of your observing requirements directly with them. &nbsp;Give as much advance warning as possible so we can resolve any conflicting programs, but at least 3-5 weeks (the schedule is usually done in 2-week blocks, with requests due 3 weeks before the start of the block).</p><h2>Time charging policy</h2><p>The rules for how time is deducted from a user&#39;s observing program based on the observation type are as follows:</p><h3>Fixed-block Observations</h3><ul><li>For every fixed-block observation scheduled to be observed, an equal amount of time is deducted from the total available to that program in the semester, regardless of the quality of the data collected or whether any data were collected at all.</li><li>Programs may release a requested block (by contacting your LCOGT liaison) up to 7 days prior to the date of the scheduled observation. If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.<ul><li>This policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Queue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)</h3><ul><li>These observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.</li><li>Queue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are<br />attempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality. No time refunds<br />will be given for cloudy conditions, poor focus, and/or other technical<br />problems with the camera or telescope, for instance.</li></ul><h3>ToO Observations</h3><ul><li>ToO observations will be charged once triggered, regardless of the quality or delivery of the data. If the ToO agent is controlling the telescope, that time is debited from the program.</li></ul>",

The telescope which achieved first light in July of 2004, has been heavily used for exoplanet microlensing studies, supernova characterization and near-Earth object research, with over 100 peer-reviewed papers relying on data from the telescope on an annual basis. The telescope has also been a staple for high school and undergraduate astronomy programs around the world.</p></div><p>Temperatures at the LCOGT site reached 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) on the day of the fire. For a time, the webcams at LCOGT were being used by the fire service to monitor the fire. A <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/egomez/siding-spring-safe-bush-fire\">compilation of the webcam images</a> shows the intensity of the fire. Power to the site was lost when Two new dome enclosures, each ready to house one of LCOGT&rsquo;s new 1-meter telescopes were undamaged.

The telescope which achieved first light in July of 2004, has been heavily used for exoplanet microlensing studies, supernova characterization and near-Earth object research, with over 100 peer-reviewed papers relying on data from the telescope on an annual basis. The telescope has also been a staple for high school and undergraduate astronomy programs around the world.</p></div><p>Temperatures at the LCOGT site reached 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) on the day of the fire. For a time, the webcams at LCOGT were being used by the fire service to monitor the fire. A <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/egomez/siding-spring-safe-bush-fire\">compilation of the webcam images</a> shows the intensity of the fire.

These images were taken between 09:53 and 11:28 on 15 February, and give a clear picture of how fast the asteroid is travelling.</p><p>The elongated shape is because the asteroid is very slightly trailed in the images, even though the exposure times were low (~5s in Solar filter). There appears to be change in the asteroid&#39;s shape which may indicate it is rotating and non-spherical.</p><p>(Animation was made with Adobe Photoshop, painstakingly aligning each frame on the the asteroid and attempting to balance the contrast and brightness. It was then exported to an animated GIF. There are 5 frames were the telescope tracks the asteroid not the sky, where the asteroid looks round and everything else is trailed. I included those to see what a difference it makes to our perception of the flight of 2012 DA14.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The telescopes, first built and tested at the company&#39;s <a href=\"/site/santa-barbara\">Santa Barbara</a> headquarters, were delivered to the SAAO site Monday, February 18th 2013. Five days later, on the night of February 22, all three telescopes were on-sky.<br /><br />Each telescope is a specially-designed homogeneous, maximally available, 1-meter telescope for the purpose of optical monitoring of time-variable sources. Each telescope must provide reliable robotic operation for long periods of time, with minimal hands-on maintenance, deliver good pointing, tracking and guiding, and provide uniform, high-quality science images. They are C-ring equatorial mount, with an optical design comprised of an f/2.5 Hextek lightweight primary mirror and a 330mm diameter Hextek secondary, optically ﬁnished by LZOS in Russia, providing an f/8 modiﬁed Ritchey-Chretien system, with the addition of a doublet corrector in front of the instrument package. The system is designed for 80% enclosed energy within a circle of diameter 0.6 arcsec.<br /><br />A small installation team of five arrived a week before the telescopes and installed the piers and cryogenic cooling systems. When the telescopes arrived, they were quickly craned into the three waiting domes, and reassembled. The telescopes were then wired into the pre-installed electrical systems. The team then mechanically aligned the primary mirrors, installed the optical tube assembly including the secondary, and mechanically aligned that.

This was the first school I visited, giving a talk mostly about astronomy but also a very brief introduction to LCOGT and some of our programmes, particularly <a href=\"http://portal.lcogt.net/agentexoplanet\">Agent Exoplanet</a>. I was talking to the &#39;honours&#39; group who are students who elect to take extra lessons which broaden their academic knowledge into areas they are not studying for A-level, like astronomy. These extra lessons are to prepare the students for the ordeals ahead of them when they apply into Oxford, Cambridge and Russell Group universities.<br /><br />I gave them an hour long talk, which they then asked 20 minutes of questions afterwards, which hopefully is a measure of how interested they were.

Sadly the weather did not cooperate, as is often the case in Wales, but this did not seem to hamper the enthusiasm of the visitors who asked searching astronomy questions to all of us. We managed to give the visitors the odd glimpse of the Moon through gaps in the cloud, using a couple of the University&#39;s 4&quot; reflecting telescopes.

As with all primary schools talks and workshops I give, I used a mixture of <a href=\"http://unawe.org\">Universe Awareness</a> and <a href=\"/education\">LCOGT activities</a>. I was fortunate enough to have been given a prototype <a href=\"http://www.unawe.org/resources/universebox/\">Universe in a Box</a> kit which Universe Awareness is in the process of developing. From that kit we investigated the scale of Earth and the Moon, where the phases of the Moon come from and why we always see the same face of the Moon (which involves making masks using pictures of the Moon).<br /><br />Next we explored telescopes. I talked them through some pictures of telescopes, explaining why there are so many different styles of telescope, why we need them and what types of thing you can see with each of them.

I sent a request to the &#39;telescope&#39; by writing the name of one of the planets and passing it down the &#39;internet&#39;.

In the last six months, Tekola, who holds a Ph.D. in observational astronomy, has turned a wrench and manned a hoist, among other tasks, in the installation of three robotic telescopes and the underlying IT and electrical systems.</p><p>Tekola, based at the SAAO headquarters in Cape Town, has supported two separate teams from LCOGT during installation visits to the SAAO site outside Sutherland. The first team, arriving in September of last year, installed electrical and computer systems for three domes. The second team arrived with three 1-meter telescopes in mid-February of this year, and installed and tuned the telescopes before they left. Tekola worked as a full-fledged member of both crews.</p><p>The SAAO node is LCOGT&rsquo;s third node of a planned global telescope. The first node at McDonald Observatory in Texas currently houses a single 1-meter telescope. The second node at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile has three operational 1-meter telescopes. A fourth node of two 1-meters is planned for Siding Spring Observatory during May or early June of this year.</p><p>Jon DeVera, Senior Electrical Engineer, explained the objectives of the first install trip. &ldquo;The domes and a lot of the site work were already in place. We came in with a control panel for each telescope and one for each dome. We cabled and installed fiber for the entire site from our central panel out to each dome. Then we installed the telescope panel and dome panel in each dome, wired them in and tested them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We had Abiy doing pretty much everything,&rdquo; DeVera said. He pulled cable, tested systems, and worked a spanner and screwdriver like the rest of us.&rdquo;</p><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1790\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"409\",\"id\":\"3\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"331\"}}]]</p><p><em>Tekola, left, works with Mark Crellin, Annie Hjelstrom, and Kurt Vander Horst to lift a 1-meter mirror into one of LCOGT&rsquo;s SAAO domes</em></p><p>The second team, installing the telescopes, worked under the direction of lead engineer Annie Hjelstrom. Hjelstrom also used Tekola as a full member of the team. Abiy helped build all three telescopes, install the mirrors and instrument packages, and worked on the painstaking wiring and testing of the telescopes. After the first of the three telescopes was reconstructed, the team started working nights as well as days to begin collimating and aligning the telescopes. Tekola ascended the mountain to participate in these night shifts also. By the third night, he was working out how to use the telescopes to make his own observations.</p><p>He came by his science, and his role at LCOGT, through a circuitous path.</p><p><strong>Ethiopian Emissary</strong></p><p>Abiy was fascinated by astronomy at a young age. He remembers looking out at the night sky and wondering, &ldquo;What keeps the stars hanging there?&rdquo;</p><p>He was born and grew up in Debrezeit, Ethiopia, about 50 km from the capital of Addis Abada. Debrezeit, a small city of roughly 100,000, is home to an air force base, and has good schools. But, Abiy recalls that repeated searches of the school library turned up no astronomy books.</p><p>Not until Abiy attended Alemaya (now Haramaya) University did his physics professor, Girma Gonfa, lend him a 1970s astronomy text. &ldquo;I read that book cover-to-cover several times,&rdquo; Abiy recalled. &ldquo;Then I lent it to my friends and they all read it.&rdquo;</p><p>The book was terribly outdated, but it gave him a basis, and further piqued his curiosity. &ldquo;I heard about black holes for the first time that year. It was mind-blowing.&rdquo;</p><p>From that point on, Abiy shifted his focus to astronomy. He received a BS in Physics from Alemaya and accepted a year-long graduate assistant in physics position with Mekelle University. Following this, he was accepted at Addis Abada University for the Masters in Science program in Theoretical Cosmology and Astrophysics. But before he could even get started there, Abiy met professor Legesse Kebede, who introduced him to the newly-formed National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP - <a href=\"http://www.star.ac.za/\">http://www.star.ac.za/</a>) based in South Africa.</p><p>The initiative, centered at the University of Cape Town (UCT), offers masters and doctoral programs in both astrophysics and in space and scientific engineering. The intent is to develop the technical talent needed to bring South Africa&rsquo;s investment in astronomy to fruition. In addition to an intensive curriculum at UCT, students spent time in the field at the SAAO site at Sutherland where the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is located, the radio telescope facility at Hartebeesthoek, and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS). Recruiting efforts for the program were spread across the entire African continent.</p><p>Abiy applied immediately, was accepted, and left to join 16 other students in the program in 2005. Abiy had traversed Ethiopia, but this was his first venture outside his home country. The following year, Abiy participated in an exchange program with Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s Astrophysics Department, in Nashville, Tennessee. These experiences outside Ethiopia were revelatory.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethiopia is different than most other African countries,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It is a more closed and homogenous society than most other African countries partly because it was never colonized.&rdquo; Encountering people from other African countries, and then from the United States and elsewhere in the world, Abiy found he had to become more gregarious and develop social skills.</p><p>Outreach was a component of Abiy&rsquo;s MSc program that he enjoyed. He was finally able to answer in some detail what keeps the stars hanging there. He worked with Kevin Govender who was the head of Education at SAAO at the time. It was from Govender that he learned of the open joint LCOGT-SAAO postdoc position of which outreach was an important element.</p><p>&quot;I applied for the position and the interview was set up two days before my thesis was due. I met with Edward Gomez the Education Director, and it sounded like an excellent fit.&rdquo; It was.</p><p>&ldquo;Abiy is ideal for the South Africa observatory node,&rdquo; Gomez said. &ldquo;He combines observational astronomy with great outreach skills, and as we&rsquo;ve now learned, the ability to jump in with technical crews and actually complete installations.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, Abiy continues outreach activities with the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Global Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD), based at SAAO in Cape Town. Govender is the director of this new organization dedicated to bringing astronomy to Africa.</p><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1791\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image\",\"id\":\"3\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><em>Tekola and Hjelstrom installing the LCOGT Sinistro 1-meter instrument package</em></p><p>Abiy&rsquo;s scientific focus is on the environment and star formation properties of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). For this work he typically uses large aperture telescopes such as SALT. His location at SAAO is ideal for that work. He has also started follow-up observations and additional time domain astronomy research which makes use of the LCOGT network.</p><p><strong>The Future of African Astronomy</strong></p><p>Abiy is one of the new breed of African astronomers. Following the lead of UNESCO and the IAU, several African countries have invested in astronomy programs at the state-run universities, and as a result are in the process of building their own observational capabilities.</p><p>South Africa has a long history in the annals of astronomy. The first observatory there was commissioned in 1820 and was used as a navigational center for the British navy. The program expanded into astronomical research starting in the 1930s and spread to observatories in Pretoria and Johannesburg. A 1970s initiative to integrate and centralize the program resulted in moving the three major functional telescopes form the coastal locations and placed them on a ridge 15 km east of Sutherland, some 400 km inland.&nbsp; The investment in SALT was made in the 1980s, bringing in an era of modern astronomy.</p><p>Since that time, England turned over the sites and operations to South Africa and a robust national focus has been applied to astronomical research. In recent years, a handful of international astronomy projects added observing resources at the SAAO Sutherland site. Like other countries seeking to bolster their standing in sciences and math, South Africa has invested in astrophysics and space science as the most challenging and visionary of the sciences.</p><p>Other countries include Ethiopia where the Ethiopian Space Science Society (ESSS) is completing two observatory sites with 1-meter optical telescopes, and Kenya, where the Search for An Astronomical Site in Kenya (SASKA) project plans to build an observatory of international standing by 2017. Abiy was a founding member of the ESSS and continues to work with Dr. David&nbsp; Buckley, SALT Science Director and advisor to the ESSS.</p><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1792\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image\",\"id\":\"3\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><em>A portion of the SAAO observing deck. LCOGT are the three identical domes in the foreground.

In the last six months, Tekola, who holds a Ph.D. in observational astronomy, has turned a wrench and manned a hoist, among other tasks, in the installation of three robotic telescopes and the underlying IT and electrical systems.</p><p>Tekola, based at the SAAO headquarters in Cape Town, has supported two separate teams from LCOGT during installation visits to the SAAO site outside Sutherland. The first team, arriving in September of last year, installed electrical and computer systems for three domes. The second team arrived with three 1-meter telescopes in mid-February of this year, and installed and tuned the telescopes before they left. Tekola worked as a full-fledged member of both crews.</p><p>The SAAO node is LCOGT&rsquo;s third node of a planned global telescope. The first node at McDonald Observatory in Texas currently houses a single 1-meter telescope. The second node at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile has three operational 1-meter telescopes. A fourth node of two 1-meters is planned for Siding Spring Observatory during May or early June of this year.</p><p>Jon DeVera, Senior Electrical Engineer, explained the objectives of the first install trip. &ldquo;The domes and a lot of the site work were already in place. We came in with a control panel for each telescope and one for each dome. We cabled and installed fiber for the entire site from our central panel out to each dome. Then we installed the telescope panel and dome panel in each dome, wired them in and tested them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We had Abiy doing pretty much everything,&rdquo; DeVera said. He pulled cable, tested systems, and worked a spanner and screwdriver like the rest of us.&rdquo;</p><p><span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img width=\"331\" height=\"409\" id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/media/IMG_9831.JPG?itok=FHu9btQi\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span></p><p><em>Tekola, left, works with Mark Crellin, Annie Hjelstrom, and Kurt Vander Horst to lift a 1-meter mirror into one of LCOGT&rsquo;s SAAO domes</em></p><p>The second team, installing the telescopes, worked under the direction of lead engineer Annie Hjelstrom. Hjelstrom also used Tekola as a full member of the team. Abiy helped build all three telescopes, install the mirrors and instrument packages, and worked on the painstaking wiring and testing of the telescopes. After the first of the three telescopes was reconstructed, the team started working nights as well as days to begin collimating and aligning the telescopes. Tekola ascended the mountain to participate in these night shifts also. By the third night, he was working out how to use the telescopes to make his own observations.</p><p>He came by his science, and his role at LCOGT, through a circuitous path.</p><p><strong>Ethiopian Emissary</strong></p><p>Abiy was fascinated by astronomy at a young age. He remembers looking out at the night sky and wondering, &ldquo;What keeps the stars hanging there?&rdquo;</p><p>He was born and grew up in Debrezeit, Ethiopia, about 50 km from the capital of Addis Abada. Debrezeit, a small city of roughly 100,000, is home to an air force base, and has good schools. But, Abiy recalls that repeated searches of the school library turned up no astronomy books.</p><p>Not until Abiy attended Alemaya (now Haramaya) University did his physics professor, Girma Gonfa, lend him a 1970s astronomy text. &ldquo;I read that book cover-to-cover several times,&rdquo; Abiy recalled. &ldquo;Then I lent it to my friends and they all read it.&rdquo;</p><p>The book was terribly outdated, but it gave him a basis, and further piqued his curiosity. &ldquo;I heard about black holes for the first time that year. It was mind-blowing.&rdquo;</p><p>From that point on, Abiy shifted his focus to astronomy. He received a BS in Physics from Alemaya and accepted a year-long graduate assistant in physics position with Mekelle University. Following this, he was accepted at Addis Abada University for the Masters in Science program in Theoretical Cosmology and Astrophysics. But before he could even get started there, Abiy met professor Legesse Kebede, who introduced him to the newly-formed National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP - <a href=\"http://www.star.ac.za/\">http://www.star.ac.za/</a>) based in South Africa.</p><p>The initiative, centered at the University of Cape Town (UCT), offers masters and doctoral programs in both astrophysics and in space and scientific engineering. The intent is to develop the technical talent needed to bring South Africa&rsquo;s investment in astronomy to fruition. In addition to an intensive curriculum at UCT, students spent time in the field at the SAAO site at Sutherland where the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is located, the radio telescope facility at Hartebeesthoek, and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS). Recruiting efforts for the program were spread across the entire African continent.</p><p>Abiy applied immediately, was accepted, and left to join 16 other students in the program in 2005. Abiy had traversed Ethiopia, but this was his first venture outside his home country. The following year, Abiy participated in an exchange program with Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s Astrophysics Department, in Nashville, Tennessee. These experiences outside Ethiopia were revelatory.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethiopia is different than most other African countries,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It is a more closed and homogenous society than most other African countries partly because it was never colonized.&rdquo; Encountering people from other African countries, and then from the United States and elsewhere in the world, Abiy found he had to become more gregarious and develop social skills.</p><p>Outreach was a component of Abiy&rsquo;s MSc program that he enjoyed. He was finally able to answer in some detail what keeps the stars hanging there. He worked with Kevin Govender who was the head of Education at SAAO at the time. It was from Govender that he learned of the open joint LCOGT-SAAO postdoc position of which outreach was an important element.</p><p>&quot;I applied for the position and the interview was set up two days before my thesis was due. I met with Edward Gomez the Education Director, and it sounded like an excellent fit.&rdquo; It was.</p><p>&ldquo;Abiy is ideal for the South Africa observatory node,&rdquo; Gomez said. &ldquo;He combines observational astronomy with great outreach skills, and as we&rsquo;ve now learned, the ability to jump in with technical crews and actually complete installations.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, Abiy continues outreach activities with the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Global Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD), based at SAAO in Cape Town. Govender is the director of this new organization dedicated to bringing astronomy to Africa.</p><p><span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/media/IMG_9896.JPG?itok=EUEI7kJa\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span></p><p><em>Tekola and Hjelstrom installing the LCOGT Sinistro 1-meter instrument package</em></p><p>Abiy&rsquo;s scientific focus is on the environment and star formation properties of luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). For this work he typically uses large aperture telescopes such as SALT. His location at SAAO is ideal for that work. He has also started follow-up observations and additional time domain astronomy research which makes use of the LCOGT network.</p><p><strong>The Future of African Astronomy</strong></p><p>Abiy is one of the new breed of African astronomers. Following the lead of UNESCO and the IAU, several African countries have invested in astronomy programs at the state-run universities, and as a result are in the process of building their own observational capabilities.</p><p>South Africa has a long history in the annals of astronomy. The first observatory there was commissioned in 1820 and was used as a navigational center for the British navy. The program expanded into astronomical research starting in the 1930s and spread to observatories in Pretoria and Johannesburg. A 1970s initiative to integrate and centralize the program resulted in moving the three major functional telescopes form the coastal locations and placed them on a ridge 15 km east of Sutherland, some 400 km inland.&nbsp; The investment in SALT was made in the 1980s, bringing in an era of modern astronomy.</p><p>Since that time, England turned over the sites and operations to South Africa and a robust national focus has been applied to astronomical research. In recent years, a handful of international astronomy projects added observing resources at the SAAO Sutherland site. Like other countries seeking to bolster their standing in sciences and math, South Africa has invested in astrophysics and space science as the most challenging and visionary of the sciences.</p><p>Other countries include Ethiopia where the Ethiopian Space Science Society (ESSS) is completing two observatory sites with 1-meter optical telescopes, and Kenya, where the Search for An Astronomical Site in Kenya (SASKA) project plans to build an observatory of international standing by 2017. Abiy was a founding member of the ESSS and continues to work with Dr. David&nbsp; Buckley, SALT Science Director and advisor to the ESSS.</p><p><span id=\"styles-3-0\" class=\"styles file-styles fourcol_image\">  <img id=\"3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/styles/fourcol-image/public/media/IMG_8931.JPG?itok=HlanaBak\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span></p><p><em>A portion of the SAAO observing deck.

They also visited the 0.4-meter assembly area, the machine shop and staging area where control panels are commissioned, and the server room.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Students then held a question and answer session with some of the LCOGT staff. Jason Eastman, astronomer, spoke about his research in transiting exoplanets and design and construction of the Network Robotic Echelle Spectrograph (NRES). Ben Burleson, software developer, responsible for developing the low-level code that runs the component devices such as focus and drive motors and fans, talked about the integrated system that monitors and controls the robotic telescopes. Gary White, network administrator, covered the network and data management system required for a global astrophysics research institute.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Graham then provided a tutorial on how to use publicly-available data on the LCOGT website to download and create color astrophotographs, and concluded with methods of using color photometry to locate asteroids. Madison Dochterman, interning with LCOGT for the summer, participated in the event. Dochterman is perfecting and documenting the astrophotography methodology.

Students toured the Goleta facility where they viewed the 1-meter telescope master observatory where new components and instrumentation is tested, and the 1-meter assembly area. They also visited the 0.4-meter assembly area, the machine shop and staging area where control panels are commissioned, and the server room.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Students then held a question and answer session with some of the LCOGT staff. Jason Eastman, astronomer, spoke about his research in transiting exoplanets and design and construction of the Network Robotic Echelle Spectrograph (NRES). Ben Burleson, software developer, responsible for developing the low-level code that runs the component devices such as focus and drive motors and fans, talked about the integrated system that monitors and controls the robotic telescopes. Gary White, network administrator, covered the network and data management system required for a global astrophysics research institute.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Graham then provided a tutorial on how to use publicly-available data on the LCOGT website to download and create color astrophotographs, and concluded with methods of using color photometry to locate asteroids. Madison Dochterman, interning with LCOGT for the summer, participated in the event. Dochterman is perfecting and documenting the astrophotography methodology.

Las Cumbres Observatory had just installed its first 1-meter (of 9 to date at four locations around the world) at McDonald Observatory.</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-65fa4a7e-3607-fd4e-c7e9-d88af33b45b5\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;McDonald Observatory,&rdquo; explained Rosing, &ldquo;is far and away the best public outreach program I&rsquo;m aware for astronomy.

It is the largest aperture telescope among the more than ten telescopes available to the public, and the only robotic telescope. McDonald Observatory did the site engineering and ran the cabling into the Rebecca Gale Telescope Park behind the Frank N. Bash Visitors Center.

Rather than break a bottle of champagne over the telescope, the ceremony included the stomping of jalapeno peppers. A tradition started several years ago by Bill Wren of McDonald, the pepper stomping attracted adults and children, and Dr. Chow, who attended the ceremonies also stomped a chile.</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-65fa4a7e-3607-fd4e-c7e9-d88af33b45b5\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In addition to Dr. Chow and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, other major supporters of this project include Wayne Rosing and Dorothy Largay, the estate of Leopold Tedesco, and the Frank &amp; Susan Bash Endowed Chair for the Director of the McDonald Observatory.</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.15; font-size: 1em;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-65fa4a7e-3607-fd4e-c7e9-d88af33b45b5\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A Global Telescope</span></span></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-65fa4a7e-3607-fd4e-c7e9-d88af33b45b5\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">LCOGT is a private, nonprofit science institute engaged in time domain astrophysics, formed in 2005.

However, we also offer background-priority ranking, which can be selected on the proposal form. Background programs are intended to fill gaps in the schedule when no other program can be done, by providing reservoir of observations which can be executed at any time and (ideally) in any conditions. Please note that only queue-scheduled observations can be made through a background proposal, and no guarantees can be made as to its execution. Nevertheless, background proposals should clearly state the amount of time requested. All other proposals should go through the standard TAC-ranked channel.</p><p>To those connected with programs to which we already have made major commitments (e.g. the schools programs, U. Hawaii, ANU, ARI, and Robonet.) I ask that you please submit proposals anyway. In particular, please tell me the fraction of hours that you expect to use for fixed-group observing, for queue-scheduled observing, (flexible and monitor groups), and for ToO observing. I will email each of these groups separately in a few days with the number of hours that they may expect to receive this semester.</p><h2>How do I apply?</h2><p>Instructions on how to apply for telescope time can be found on the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/science/article/guidelines-applying-telescope-time\">Guidelines for applying for telescope time</a> page:<br /><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/science/article/guidelines-applying-telescope-time\" target=\"_blank\">http://lcogt.net/science/article/guidelines-applying-telescope-time</a><br />where you can download the Latex template and style files for your proposal.<br /><br />To submit the proposal, you will need to register at our <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/science/tac/\">2-meter proposal portal</a>:<br /><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/science/tac/\" target=\"_blank\">http://lcogt.net/science/tac/</a><br />and then follow the Submit Proposal link.</p><h2>Types of observation</h2><p>We ask users to propose for time based on the type of observing required by their programs, as reflected in the Proposal Template. &nbsp;These types are Fixed-block, Queue-scheduled, and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. This distinction is necessary because the observation types differ with respect to the mechanism by which observations are scheduled, and the expected cost in telescope resource per hour of on-sky time.<br /><br />If you desire fixed-block time, <strong>do not</strong> pad your request to allow for possible bad weather; &nbsp;ask for what your science requires. &nbsp;The TAC will take weather into account (up to a factor of 2 padding) without your asking. &nbsp;If, however, such padding does not make sense (perhaps you wish to observe a once-in-a-century event, for which repeat observing is not possible), then please put a statement to this effect in the body of your proposal.<br /><br />If the TAC awards you fixed-block observing time for your science you will be allocated an LCOGT liaison astronomer. Please coordinate the scheduling and the particulars of your observing requirements directly with them. &nbsp;Give as much advance warning as possible so we can resolve any conflicting programs, but at least 3-5 weeks (the schedule is usually done in 2-week blocks, with requests due 3 weeks before the start of the block).</p><h2>Time charging policy</h2><p>The rules for how time is deducted from a user&#39;s observing program based on the observation type are as follows:</p><h3>Fixed-block Observations</h3><ul><li>For every fixed-block observation scheduled to be observed, an equal amount of time is deducted from the total available to that program in the semester, regardless of the quality of the data collected or whether any data were collected at all.</li><li>Programs may release a requested block (by contacting your LCOGT liaison) up to 7 days prior to the date of the scheduled observation. If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.<ul><li>This policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Queue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)</h3><ul><li>These observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.</li><li>Queue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are<br />attempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality. No time refunds<br />will be given for cloudy conditions, poor focus, and/or other technical<br />problems with the camera or telescope, for instance.</li></ul><h3>ToO Observations</h3><ul><li>ToO observations will be charged once triggered, regardless of the quality or delivery of the data. If the ToO agent is controlling the telescope, that time is debited from the program.</li></ul>",

The 2014B semester runs from October 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015.</p><p class=\"messages warning\"><strong>Letters of Intent for Key Projects must be submitted by December 1, 2013.<br />Proposals for Key Projects must be submitted by January 10 , 2014.</strong></p><p>LCOGT is planning to dedicate up to 50% of its <a href=\"/observatory/1m\">1-meter</a> and <a href=\"/observatory/2m\">2-meter telescope</a> time starting in semester 2014A to key projects. Key projects are large, coherent observing programs designed to take maximum advantage of the unique attributes of the LCOGT network to address important astrophysical problems. Our goal is to highlight for the world the best science that can be done with the LCOGT network. It is anticipated that key projects will have a minimum duration of one year and a maximum of three years. We expect to issue a call for new key project to start each year, and so it is unlikely that the entire pool of key project time will be allocated in this first year. We expect to approve two or three key projects to start this year. Time not allocated for key projects will be available for standard proposals, for which a call will be issued near the end of January 2014. The expected 1-year total of time available for key projects through this call is approximately 6000 hours of 1-meter time and 1200 hours of 2-meter time.</p><p>This call is the first announcement of time available for V1.0 of the LCOGT network. This means that a limited complement of capabilities will be available and fully supported. At this time, we believe that this will include the <a href=\"/observatory/instruments/sinistro\">Sinistro</a> cameras on all <a href=\"/observatory/1m\">1-meter</a> telescopes and the <a href=\"/observatory/instruments/floyds\">FLOYDS spectrographs</a> on the <a href=\"/observatory/2m\">2-meter telescopes</a>. More details of the V1.0 capabilities are listed below. At this time, we anticipate that V1.0 observations will begin on April 1, 2014, but the start of the semes ter will be delayed if critical aspects of the system are not ready.</p><p>Key projects will be large efforts &ndash; involving several thousand hours of observation. We expect that project teams will form to carry these out. The level of effort will be significant but the potential return is great. Because LCOGT is contributing large amounts of telescope time to support this program, we require that collaborators on proposing teams coming from other institutions commit significant resources to the effort. Such resources could be access to other facilities, or additional time on the LCOGT network from their own institution, or computing resources, or scientist time.</p><p>We invite all LCOGT collaborators to submit proposals to the LCOGT Key Project Program. This includes the LCOGT site partners (ANU, AURA &ndash; on behalf of the Chilean astronomical community, SAAO, IfA, and University of Texas) , including those sites (IAC and XAO) at which telescopes are planned but not yet built. It also includes the institutions with whi ch we have other types of partnerships &ndash; IPAC, University of Colorado , University of California at Santa Barbara, and St. Andrews University. Anyone who lists one of these institutions as their affiliation for published research may PI a proposal. We also invite the LCOGT extended scientific family &ndash; in addition to current staff, this includes astronomers who were postdocs at LCOGT within the last 5 years, and astronomers who contributed to our advisory and allocation committees within the last 2 years .</p><p>In order to manage this process effectively, we require that anyone who intends to submit a key project proposal submit a letter of intent by December 1, 2013. Letters of intent will allow us to identify potential collaborators and to ensure appropriate e xpertise on the TAC.</p><h3>General Information on Time Allocation</h3><p>A number of studies have shown that key projects provide the maximum scientific impact of a new facility, especially one that opens up a new area of parameter space. It had been the hope of LCOGT scientific management that the institutions that form the science collaboration would agree that jointly funding a key project program would result in a benefit to all the institutions in a way that transcended the amount of telescope time that they we re guaranteed. Ultimately, trying to work out the details of this arrangement became too difficult and complicated, and we fell back to the current position. Each partner institution can use their guaranteed time as they wish. We will provide IAC and XAO, whom we hope will soon become site partners, with a similar &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; allocation from our share of 1m time if they desire.</p><p>LCOGT has decided to institute a key project program with nominally half of our share of time on both <a href=\"/observatory/1m\">1-meter</a> and <a href=\"/observatory/2m\">2-meter telescopes</a>. The time that is not allocated to key projects will revert to the LCOGT standard project pool. From th at standard pool we will remove the time that we can sell to support operation of the entire network and a small amount to serve for Director&rsquo;s Discretionary time during the semester. The remaining time in the standard pool (along with the DD time during the semester) we will make available through a subsequent proposal process to our extended scientific staff as well as the members of the scientific collaboration who do not have their own guaranteed LCOGT network time.</p><h3>Definition of Key Projects</h3><p>Key projects are large projects that will have substantial scientific impact on problems that are widely considered to be of significant astrophysical interest . They require a large number of hours (at least 500), and may require observations over several years (nominally up to 3 years, though scientific arguments for longer periods will be entertained). Key projects often provide observational or derived data sets that are of interest to other researchers, in part because they can gather observations of a particular class of object in a coherent and uniform way.</p><p>Key projects are carried out by well organized teams with well thought out management of effort and resources. They are likely to require resources in addition to the telescope time, perhaps computing for analysis or theoretical studies , or time on larger telescopes to further follow a subset of the sample.</p><p>Key projects have a final goal; they are n ot just a data gathering exercise. It is expected that the project is designed to accomplish that goal, and that the resources are available or th ere is a plan for acquiring the needed resources .</p><h3>Review Process and Criteria</h3><p>Proposals will be reviewed by a panel of external astronomers (TAC) , from institutions that are not part of the LCOGT collaboration. They will be selected not only to ensure that their scientific expertise covers the range over which we expect to receive key project proposals, but al so in that they understand the types of observations that the LCOGT facilities can do uniquely well.</p><p>The TAC will meet for two days after having a few weeks to read and think about the proposals. They will rank the proposals based on the following criteria:</p><dl><dt>Scientific merit</dt><dd>The value that the proposed project will have both within the area of specialization and more broadly, within astronomy and science, generally .</dd><dt>Credibility of effort</dt><dd>The probability that the study can be carried out as described. Are the resources available consistent with what will be needed?</dd><dt>Experimental design</dt><dd>Are the proposed observations and other work consistent with the LCOGT network and other capabilities? Have they been thought out in sufficient detail and depth?</dd><dt>Suitability for LCOGT&rsquo;s unique capabilities</dt><dd>Does the proposed study take advantage of the unique aspects of the LCOGT network? Will this project demonstrate a result that could not be obtained without LCOGT?</dd><dt>Resources brought by other collaborators</dt><dd>Whille we want to encourage collaboration within the group of institutions that have worked together to make the LCOGT network a reality, we also want the burden of carrying out large projects like these to be shared fairly. We expect that any institution that participates in a key project will demonstrate a commitment to such a significant effort. We imagine a wide range of different types of resources may be relevant, and we leave it to proposers to be creative.</dd></dl><p>In addition to their ranking, the TAC will make a recommendation to the LCOGT Director, who will allocate the LCOGT time, based on the TAC recommendation as well as programmatic considerations.</p><p class=\"messages warning\"><strong>Announcement of successful programs will be made by February 5, 2014.</strong></p><p>In future years, this TAC will also review progress on continuing proposals and make a recommendation on whether to adjust the network time allocation relative to what has been requested.</p><h3>Instructions for Letters of Intent and for Submitting Proposals</h3><p>In order to help us better manage this process, proposers must submit a letter of intent by December 1, 2013. Letters of intent should be submitted by email to key_loi@lcogt.net , and they should include:</p><ol><li>Names and affiliations of PI and Co-Is</li><li>Title of Proposal</li><li>One paragraph description of science</li><li>One paragraph description of observations</li><li>Estimate of time requested &ndash; in 2014 and in future years</li></ol><p>Item 4, the description of the proposed observations should be a high - level summary, not a detailed list.</p><p>We intend to circulate the list of PIs and titles of projects received through letters of intent to all science collaboration representatives, which will allow them to make their staffs aware of projects they might be interested in joining as collaborators. We leave the structuring and management of these collaborations to the proposers .</p><p>As part of our release of V1.0, we are revising the interface for creating and submitting proposals. This will be a web - based form that creates a readable version of the proposal, using typed or pasted content. The key project form of this proposal will differ slightly from the standard form. It will allow two pages for scientific justification (plus two more for figures) , as well as fields for the proposer to comment on the additional information described in the criteria listed above. Access to the proposal submission interface will b e through the new lcogt.net web pages for astronomers, which will be available by December 1, 2013.</p><p>We expect to issue calls for new key projects annually. The process for review a nd approval of key projects will be separate from that for standard projects. Thus, the hours requested should be for the two semesters 2014A and 2014B. The proposal will also include a request for the desired network time allocation for future semesters through the lifetime of the project.</p><p>Proposals approved as new key projects will be required to submit annual status reports, together with requests for modifications to the allocations specified in the original proposal. These reports will be reviewed by the key project TAC in subsequent years, and the requested modifications will be considered on the basis of the TAC review.</p><h3><a href=\"/observatory/capabilities\">Observatory Capabilities</a></h3><p>As described in a recent email to the Science Collaboration, we are moving towards what we define as V1.0 of the LCOGT network. This will be a well-defined set of <a href=\"/observatory/capabilities\">capabilities</a> that are robust and properly supported. A new section of our website will provide information needed by proposers and users of our network. Although development, deployment, and commissioning are still ongoing, we expect that V1.0 will look like this:</p><ul><li>We will have four sites with operating <a href=\"/observatory/1m\">1-meter telescopes</a> &ndash; Australia, Chile, South Africa (a complete southern ring), and Texas. We will have our <a href=\"/observatory/2m\">2-meter telescopes</a> (Faulkes Telescopes) also, one in Hawaii and one in Australia, and these will be integrated with the 1-meters &ndash; same procedures for allocating telescope time, same procedures for requesting observations, same procedures for getting your data.</li><li>The instrumentation will focus on <a href=\"/observatory/instruments/sinistro\">Sinistro</a> and <a href=\"/observatory/instruments/floyds\">FLOYDS</a>. We will continue to operate the imagers on the 2-meters, but they are not guaranteed to be fully supported yet. Detailed information on the instrument capabilities can be found in the paper that Tim Brown put together (soon to appear in PASP, but now available at <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2437\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2437</a> ). Filters available on the Sinistro imagers will include all the standard LCOGT broadbands &ndash; Johnson/Bessel UBVRI and SDSS u&rsquo;,g&rsquo;,r&rsquo;,i&rsquo;,z&rsquo;, and Y.</li><li>Our scheduler will support two primary modes, cadence - driven and target-of-opportunity (ToO).<ul><li>Cadence - driven means &ldquo;I want an observation every 5 minutes (or every 6 hours, or every week) for the next 6 hours (or 6 months or 6 years).&rdquo;</li><li>ToO means &ldquo;When I send you a trigger, I want an observation (or a cadence - driven sequence) to start within 15 minutes.&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>The aspects of observatory operation that are required for good science data quality will be in place. Robustness of the network will be monitored. Commissioning will include and document the procedures for taking and reducing data in order to produce high quality results. Documentation for users will be available. A scientific support mechanism will be established.</li><li>Finally, data management and processing will be robust .&nbsp;<a href=\"/observatory/data/pipeline\"> Automatic pipeline processing</a> will remove the instrumental signature, and data will be transferred to <a href=\"http://lcogtarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/\">our archive at IPAC</a>. Users will be able to find and download final reduced data from the archive the day after their observations were made or quick reduced data immediately after an observation.</li></ul><p>While this description is admittedly not very technical, our goal is to do as well as we can in these areas within the constraints of our limited resources. We intend to document the performance of our network, telescopes, and instruments on our website to provide proposers and users with adequate information to plan and carry out their observations successfully, and to analyze their data.</p><p>Please watch this website, and in particular, our new web pages for <a href=\"/observatory/capabilities\">astronomers with this information</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>",

At this time, we anticipate that V1.0 observations will begin on April 1, 2014, but the start of the semes ter will be delayed if critical aspects of the system are not ready.</p><p>Key projects will be large efforts &ndash; involving several thousand hours of observation. We expect that project teams will form to carry these out. The level of effort will be significant but the potential return is great. Because LCOGT is contributing large amounts of telescope time to support this program, we require that collaborators on proposing teams coming from other institutions commit significant resources to the effort. Such resources could be access to other facilities, or additional time on the LCOGT network from their own institution, or computing resources, or scientist time.</p><p>We invite all LCOGT collaborators to submit proposals to the LCOGT Key Project Program. This includes the LCOGT site partners (ANU, AURA &ndash; on behalf of the Chilean astronomical community, SAAO, IfA, and University of Texas) , including those sites (IAC and XAO) at which telescopes are planned but not yet built. It also includes the institutions with whi ch we have other types of partnerships &ndash; IPAC, University of Colorado , University of California at Santa Barbara, and St. Andrews University. Anyone who lists one of these institutions as their affiliation for published research may PI a proposal. We also invite the LCOGT extended scientific family &ndash; in addition to current staff, this includes astronomers who were postdocs at LCOGT within the last 5 years, and astronomers who contributed to our advisory and allocation committees within the last 2 years .</p><p>In order to manage this process effectively, we require that anyone who intends to submit a key project proposal submit a letter of intent by December 1, 2013. Letters of intent will allow us to identify potential collaborators and to ensure appropriate e xpertise on the TAC.</p><h3>General Information on Time Allocation</h3><p>A number of studies have shown that key projects provide the maximum scientific impact of a new facility, especially one that opens up a new area of parameter space. It had been the hope of LCOGT scientific management that the institutions that form the science collaboration would agree that jointly funding a key project program would result in a benefit to all the institutions in a way that transcended the amount of telescope time that they we re guaranteed. Ultimately, trying to work out the details of this arrangement became too difficult and complicated, and we fell back to the current position. Each partner institution can use their guaranteed time as they wish. We will provide IAC and XAO, whom we hope will soon become site partners, with a similar &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; allocation from our share of 1m time if they desire.</p><p>LCOGT has decided to institute a key project program with nominally half of our share of time on both <a href=\"/observatory/1m\">1-meter</a> and <a href=\"/observatory/2m\">2-meter telescopes</a>. The time that is not allocated to key projects will revert to the LCOGT standard project pool. From th at standard pool we will remove the time that we can sell to support operation of the entire network and a small amount to serve for Director&rsquo;s Discretionary time during the semester. The remaining time in the standard pool (along with the DD time during the semester) we will make available through a subsequent proposal process to our extended scientific staff as well as the members of the scientific collaboration who do not have their own guaranteed LCOGT network time.</p><h3>Definition of Key Projects</h3><p>Key projects are large projects that will have substantial scientific impact on problems that are widely considered to be of significant astrophysical interest . They require a large number of hours (at least 500), and may require observations over several years (nominally up to 3 years, though scientific arguments for longer periods will be entertained). Key projects often provide observational or derived data sets that are of interest to other researchers, in part because they can gather observations of a particular class of object in a coherent and uniform way.</p><p>Key projects are carried out by well organized teams with well thought out management of effort and resources. They are likely to require resources in addition to the telescope time, perhaps computing for analysis or theoretical studies , or time on larger telescopes to further follow a subset of the sample.</p><p>Key projects have a final goal; they are n ot just a data gathering exercise. It is expected that the project is designed to accomplish that goal, and that the resources are available or th ere is a plan for acquiring the needed resources .</p><h3>Review Process and Criteria</h3><p>Proposals will be reviewed by a panel of external astronomers (TAC) , from institutions that are not part of the LCOGT collaboration. They will be selected not only to ensure that their scientific expertise covers the range over which we expect to receive key project proposals, but al so in that they understand the types of observations that the LCOGT facilities can do uniquely well.</p><p>The TAC will meet for two days after having a few weeks to read and think about the proposals. They will rank the proposals based on the following criteria:</p><dl><dt>Scientific merit</dt><dd>The value that the proposed project will have both within the area of specialization and more broadly, within astronomy and science, generally .</dd><dt>Credibility of effort</dt><dd>The probability that the study can be carried out as described. Are the resources available consistent with what will be needed?</dd><dt>Experimental design</dt><dd>Are the proposed observations and other work consistent with the LCOGT network and other capabilities? Have they been thought out in sufficient detail and depth?</dd><dt>Suitability for LCOGT&rsquo;s unique capabilities</dt><dd>Does the proposed study take advantage of the unique aspects of the LCOGT network? Will this project demonstrate a result that could not be obtained without LCOGT?</dd><dt>Resources brought by other collaborators</dt><dd>Whille we want to encourage collaboration within the group of institutions that have worked together to make the LCOGT network a reality, we also want the burden of carrying out large projects like these to be shared fairly. We expect that any institution that participates in a key project will demonstrate a commitment to such a significant effort. We imagine a wide range of different types of resources may be relevant, and we leave it to proposers to be creative.</dd></dl><p>In addition to their ranking, the TAC will make a recommendation to the LCOGT Director, who will allocate the LCOGT time, based on the TAC recommendation as well as programmatic considerations.</p><p class=\"messages warning\"><strong>Announcement of successful programs will be made by February 5, 2014.</strong></p><p>In future years, this TAC will also review progress on continuing proposals and make a recommendation on whether to adjust the network time allocation relative to what has been requested.</p><h3>Instructions for Letters of Intent and for Submitting Proposals</h3><p>In order to help us better manage this process, proposers must submit a letter of intent by December 1, 2013. Letters of intent should be submitted by email to key_loi@lcogt.net , and they should include:</p><ol><li>Names and affiliations of PI and Co-Is</li><li>Title of Proposal</li><li>One paragraph description of science</li><li>One paragraph description of observations</li><li>Estimate of time requested &ndash; in 2014 and in future years</li></ol><p>Item 4, the description of the proposed observations should be a high - level summary, not a detailed list.</p><p>We intend to circulate the list of PIs and titles of projects received through letters of intent to all science collaboration representatives, which will allow them to make their staffs aware of projects they might be interested in joining as collaborators. We leave the structuring and management of these collaborations to the proposers .</p><p>As part of our release of V1.0, we are revising the interface for creating and submitting proposals. This will be a web - based form that creates a readable version of the proposal, using typed or pasted content. The key project form of this proposal will differ slightly from the standard form. It will allow two pages for scientific justification (plus two more for figures) , as well as fields for the proposer to comment on the additional information described in the criteria listed above. Access to the proposal submission interface will b e through the new lcogt.net web pages for astronomers, which will be available by December 1, 2013.</p><p>We expect to issue calls for new key projects annually. The process for review a nd approval of key projects will be separate from that for standard projects. Thus, the hours requested should be for the two semesters 2014A and 2014B. The proposal will also include a request for the desired network time allocation for future semesters through the lifetime of the project.</p><p>Proposals approved as new key projects will be required to submit annual status reports, together with requests for modifications to the allocations specified in the original proposal. These reports will be reviewed by the key project TAC in subsequent years, and the requested modifications will be considered on the basis of the TAC review.</p><h3><a href=\"/observatory/capabilities\">Observatory Capabilities</a></h3><p>As described in a recent email to the Science Collaboration, we are moving towards what we define as V1.0 of the LCOGT network. This will be a well-defined set of <a href=\"/observatory/capabilities\">capabilities</a> that are robust and properly supported. A new section of our website will provide information needed by proposers and users of our network. Although development, deployment, and commissioning are still ongoing, we expect that V1.0 will look like this:</p><ul><li>We will have four sites with operating <a href=\"/observatory/1m\">1-meter telescopes</a> &ndash; Australia, Chile, South Africa (a complete southern ring), and Texas. We will have our <a href=\"/observatory/2m\">2-meter telescopes</a> (Faulkes Telescopes) also, one in Hawaii and one in Australia, and these will be integrated with the 1-meters &ndash; same procedures for allocating telescope time, same procedures for requesting observations, same procedures for getting your data.</li><li>The instrumentation will focus on <a href=\"/observatory/instruments/sinistro\">Sinistro</a> and <a href=\"/observatory/instruments/floyds\">FLOYDS</a>. We will continue to operate the imagers on the 2-meters, but they are not guaranteed to be fully supported yet. Detailed information on the instrument capabilities can be found in the paper that Tim Brown put together (soon to appear in PASP, but now available at <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2437\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2437</a> ). Filters available on the Sinistro imagers will include all the standard LCOGT broadbands &ndash; Johnson/Bessel UBVRI and SDSS u&rsquo;,g&rsquo;,r&rsquo;,i&rsquo;,z&rsquo;, and Y.</li><li>Our scheduler will support two primary modes, cadence - driven and target-of-opportunity (ToO).<ul><li>Cadence - driven means &ldquo;I want an observation every 5 minutes (or every 6 hours, or every week) for the next 6 hours (or 6 months or 6 years).&rdquo;</li><li>ToO means &ldquo;When I send you a trigger, I want an observation (or a cadence - driven sequence) to start within 15 minutes.&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>The aspects of observatory operation that are required for good science data quality will be in place. Robustness of the network will be monitored. Commissioning will include and document the procedures for taking and reducing data in order to produce high quality results. Documentation for users will be available. A scientific support mechanism will be established.</li><li>Finally, data management and processing will be robust .&nbsp;<a href=\"/observatory/data/pipeline\"> Automatic pipeline processing</a> will remove the instrumental signature, and data will be transferred to <a href=\"http://lcogtarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/\">our archive at IPAC</a>. Users will be able to find and download final reduced data from the archive the day after their observations were made or quick reduced data immediately after an observation.</li></ul><p>While this description is admittedly not very technical, our goal is to do as well as we can in these areas within the constraints of our limited resources. We intend to document the performance of our network, telescopes, and instruments on our website to provide proposers and users with adequate information to plan and carry out their observations successfully, and to analyze their data.</p><p>Please watch this website, and in particular, our new web pages for <a href=\"/observatory/capabilities\">astronomers with this information</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>",

In early 2012 I was very flattered to be asked to chair a task force, along with <a href=\"http://pedro.scienceoffice.org/\">Pedro Russo </a>from <a href=\"http://unawe.org\">Universe Awareness</a>, for <a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/task-forces/children-and-schools/\">children and schools</a> after <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/blog/egomez/astronomy-better-world\">attending a workshop in Cape Town</a>. There are 2 other task forces, along with ours, which tackle issues of <a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/task-forces/public-outreach/\">public engagement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/task-forces/children-and-schools/\">universities and research</a>.</p><p>The aims of OAD are to promote the use of astronomy as a tool or route for development. The work of the OAD is not just applicable in the developing world but anywhere that development is needed. This could be rural Africa or it could be in inner-city regions of London. Astronomy is a perfect subject to capture people&#39;s imagination and then use to nurture critical thinking and scientific understanding.</p><p>The recent meeting in Cape Town was the first time all the task force chairs met in person with IAU representatives to talk about the past 2 years of OAD activities and what the future direction of the task forces should be. To produce a measurable change in the development of just one country is an enormous task, let alone working out a strategy for the whole World. The small team at the OAD, lead by Kevin Govender, are putting a great deal of effort to bring different communities together in recognising how an initiative like this can be a very powerful way of making that measurable difference. I have been to the European Parliament with Kevin to lobby MEPs on this topic, and know it is very hard work.</p><p>As task forces, there are several ways that we help this effort.</p><h2>Panel of experts</h2><p>[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"1974\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-image\",\"id\":\"3\",\"style\":\"font-size: 1em;;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><div><br /><p>Each task force has between 6 and 9 members in addition to the chairs. Each person was&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">chosen&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">because of their experience and standing in the fields of education, research and public engagement in astronomy. The members are from all over the World to make sure there is no cultural bias. That tends to make having a meeting really awkward, but we benefit from a diverse range of perspectives and experiences. We act as advisors to the OAD about ways to make the best impression with the resources available, new ideas or funding routes and support for lobbying politicians.</span></p><h2>Funded projects</h2><p>The bulk of the work of each task force has been to review proposals for funding from members of the community (through an open call each year). Our task force has consistently attracted more proposals than both the other task forces combined, making the job of reviewing very tough. Not only the volume of proposals but also because we do not have enough funding for many excellent projects. In 2013 our task force were able to provide funds to support 5 projects (out of 93 applications). At the recent meeting we heard updates about each of them. They are:</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/category/tf2/visually-impaired/\">A touch of the Universe</a></h3><p>Tactile astronomy kits for visually impaired children to learn about astronomy. These include tactile Moon and constellation models with guidebooks printed in Braille. These kits have so far been delivered to 23 partners in all parts of the World (but especially the developing world). There are 8 more kits which awaiting extra funds to assist with delivery costs.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/category/tf2/kenya-ambassadors/\">Kenyan ambassadors programme</a></h3><p>A partnership between Polish astronomers and teachers in the Mathare slum in Nairobi. Schools in this area are paid for directly by this community, with many of the teachers not having any formal education beyond their own school studies. The programme brought vital equipment, teacher training and schools workshops to over 1500 children, as well as an astronomy festival for the whole community.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/category/tf2/gttp-nepal/\">Galileo Teacher Training in Nepal</a></h3><p>Galileo Teacher Training Programme is a global programme in astronomy education for teachers. In this project there were 43 teachers from many different schools from regions throughout the country. They attended lectures and workshops on different astronomical and space science topics given by professional and amateur astronomers, and also had an opportunity to learn more about astronomy through direct sky-viewing and observation.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/category/tf2/nase-africa/\">Network for Astronomy School Education (NASE) in Africa</a></h3><p>NASE is an IAU endorsed programme of teacher training for primary and secondary education run by professional astronomers. This project is to bring NASE to different countries in Africa (NASE has previously only run in Latin America).</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/category/tf2/ancient-greece/\">Astronomical measurements in Ancient Greece for students</a></h3><p>The aims of this project were to run workshops to inspire students by performing the same experiments that ancient greek astronomers also performed, making estimates of the sizes of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun and the distances of the Sun and Moon from the Earth. These students then engaged with their communities, spreading their excited for astronomy wider.</p><h2>Global Projects</h2><p>In addition to the requests for funding from the community, the task forces are charged with creating global scale projects which can be used for development. So far there has only been one global project, which Pedro and I were heavily involved in, <a href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org\">astroEDU</a>. astroEDU is an open-access platform for peer-reviewed astronomy education activities and was launched in October 2013.

For this reason, the orbital elements are slightly different to asteroids.</p>\r\n<p>We are very pleased to announce that from today (3 Oct 2014) we can now handle comets, and are excited about the scientific discoveries this will enable.

We have had the capability to adaptively schedule asteroids, using the statistics astronomers know about the orbit of these objects (called <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/\">Orbital Elements</a>) since 1 April 2014<sup>*</sup>. This is a complex problem for the <a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/scheduling\">robotic scheduler</a> because minor planets (asteroids and comets) are continuously moving, making them difficult to pin down and observe in a flexible way.</p>\n<p>Although asteroids and comets move around the Solar System in very similar ways, comets can have orbits which are not closed; many comets only visit the Solar System once, on what are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory\">hyperbolic orbits</a>. For this reason, the orbital elements are slightly different to asteroids.</p>\n<p>We are very pleased to announce that from today (3 Oct 2014) we can now handle comets, and are excited about the scientific discoveries this will enable. Many thanks to the whole software team for making this happen.</p>\n<p><img height=\"256\" width=\"256\" class=\"media-image media-element file-media-original\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://default/files/media/C_Siding_Spring.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Above is an animation of comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1) from our first set of observations performed using this new handling of cometary orbits. The observations where made on the LCOGT Cerro Tololo node, using a 1-meter telescope through PANSTARRS w filter. These observations were scheduled by Dr Tim Lister, who heads up our minor planet research program.</p>\n<p>* = People have been observing comets before now. They had to look up the coordinates for a particular date and time, from websites like <a href=\"http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPEph/MPEph.html\">Minor Planet Center</a> or <a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi\">JPL Horizons</a>, and ask the robotic scheduler to schedule them as if they were not moving. This approach works but is not very flexible if, for example the observing time were to change.</p>\n",

The list of eligible institutions includes LCOGT itself, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at Caltech, the University of Colorado, and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. This announcement is being sent to representatives at these institutions with the expectation that they will distribute it to their colleagues. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>INFORMATION/TOOLS FOR WRITING PROPOSALS</h3>\r\n<p>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/proposal/guidelines\">Guidelines for Writing Proposals page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Information about the capabilities of the instruments can be found on our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/instruments\">instrumentation page</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Exposure Times</h4>\r\n<p>In order to calculate exposure times with our imagers, use the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/files/lco_etc/etc_demo_embedded.html\">exposure time calculator</a>. &nbsp;For FLOYDS, see the table on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/instruments/floyds\">FLOYDS description page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>Visibility Tool</h4>\r\n<p>We have also provided a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/visibility\">visibility tool</a>&nbsp;to show how observable a given RA and Dec. are on the LCOGT network in 2 different ways: seasonal visibility, and daily visibility.</p>\r\n<h4>Observation Overheads</h4>\r\n<p>Time charged includes all the overhead associated with slewing the telescope, acquiring the target, preparing the instrument, and reading out the detector, in addition to the actual exposure time. &nbsp;Proposers should estimate the total amount of time needed for their program (queue-scheduled and target-of-opportunity separately). &nbsp;To assist in this, use the overhead information in the table on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/proposal/guidelines\">Guidelines for Writing Proposals page</a>. &nbsp;For each new object use the Slew &amp; Settle time and the Acquisition &amp; Setup time appropriate for the telescope and instrument you are using. &nbsp;Add the readout time for each separate exposure.</p>\r\n<h3>PROPOSAL PRIORITY</h3>\r\n<p>Our goal in this semester of full science operations for the integrated LCOGT network is to execute all observation requests. &nbsp;TAC priority will be used to guide choices, all other things being equal. &nbsp;Targets-of-opportunity (see below) will have a higher priority than other observations, so we ask proposers to justify their need for that mode.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: 'Century Gothic', sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;\">How do I apply?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">We have a new web-page-based&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observe/proposal/create/\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">proposal form</a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p>To submit the proposal, you will need to register at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lcogt.net/observe/auth/accounts/login/?next=http%3A//lcogt.net/observe/proposal/\">proposal portal</a>, and then follow the Create or Edit Proposals link.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of observation</h2>\r\n<p>We are supporting two types of observations: queue-scheduled and target of opportunity (ToO). &nbsp;Queue-scheduled observations are sequences of one or more \"blocks\", defined by a single window (for one) or a cadence (for more than one). &nbsp;A block is a set of integrations, intended to be executed contiguously. &nbsp;A block may be several identical exposures or it may involve filter changes, exposure time changes, or slight changes in position (dithers). &nbsp;A ToO observation is one intended to take place as quickly as possible (within 15 minutes of its availability). &nbsp;Execution of a ToO generally requires the termination of an ongoing queue-scheduled block.</p>\r\n<p>We ask proposers to justify the need for ToO observations and to separate their time request into hours needed for each type. &nbsp;These will be charged separately.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"messages warning\">Note that our definition of a Target of Opportunity (above) is different from the usual one.</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>For any proposal that has special scheduling constraints (e.g., simultaneous observations by two telescopes, multi-night or multi-site timeseries), proposers are&nbsp;<em>strongly</em>&nbsp;advised to contact LCOGT personnel for advice on feasibility before submission.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Requesting Observations</h2>\r\n<p>Both queue-scheduled and target-of-opportunity observations may be requested either through the web interface or through an API. The web interface allows you to manually describe the observation parameters and constraints, including target position, maximum acceptable airmass, and exposure time. &nbsp;It also allows you to define a sequence of exposures with a specific cadence and jitter. &nbsp;The web page provides feedback about whether the request is schedulable. &nbsp;The API allows the user to input all the information allowed by the form plus some additional parameters. &nbsp;It can also be triggered by an external event. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Data Access</h2>\r\n<p>Pipeline reduced data may be searched and downloaded through the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogtarchive.ipac.caltech.edu\">LCOGT data archive at IPAC</a>. &nbsp;Data are typically available in the archive by six hours following the end of the night at each telescope. &nbsp;In cases where quicker access to the data is scientifically justified, arrangements can be made to download \"quick-reduced\" data directly from LCOGT.</p>\r\n<p>Science data has a default proprietary period of 12 months from the time of a given observation. &nbsp;Data that has reached the end of its proprietary period is accessible from the LCOGT data archive at IPAC.</p>\r\n<h2>Time charging policy</h2>\r\n<p>Time is charged for all exposures attempted, regardless of the quality or delivery of the data. &nbsp;Time charged includes the time to slew to your target, the time to get the instrument ready to begin your exposure, the open-shutter time, and the time to readout the detector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ToO observations will be charged once triggered, regardless of the quality or delivery of the data.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The web-based observation request page will provide feedback on the number of hours of the approved allocation that have been used.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The 1-meter time is limited to 1000 hours in semester 2015A. &nbsp;Key projects are large, coherent observing programs designed to take maximum advantage of the unique attributes of the LCOGT network to address important astrophysical problems.

They require a large number of hours (at least 500), and may require observations over several years (nominally up to 3 years, though scientific arguments for longer periods will be considered). Key projects often provide observational or derived data sets that are of interest to other researchers, in part because they can gather observations of a particular class of object in a coherent and uniform way.</p>\r\n<p>Key projects are carried out by well organized teams with well thought out management of effort and resources. They are likely to require resources in addition to the telescope time, perhaps computing for analysis or theoretical studies , or time on larger telescopes to further follow a subset of the sample.</p>\r\n<p>Key projects have a final goal; they are not just a data gathering exercise. It is expected that the project is designed to accomplish that goal, and that the resources are available or there is a plan for acquiring the needed resources .</p>\r\n<h3>Review Process and Criteria</h3>\r\n<p>Proposals will be reviewed by a panel of astronomers (the TAC), primarily from institutions that are not part of the LCOGT collaboration. They will be selected not only to ensure that their scientific expertise covers the range over which we expect to receive key project proposals, but also in that they understand the types of observations that the LCOGT facilities can do uniquely well.</p>\r\n<p>The TAC will meet after having a few weeks to read and think about the proposals. They will rank the proposals based on the following criteria:</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n\t<dt>Scientific merit</dt>\r\n\t<dd>The value that the proposed project will have both within the area of specialization and more broadly, within astronomy and science, generally .</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Credibility of effort</dt>\r\n\t<dd>The probability that the study can be carried out as described. Are the resources available consistent with what will be needed?</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Experimental design</dt>\r\n\t<dd>Are the proposed observations and other work consistent with the LCOGT network and other capabilities? Have they been thought out in sufficient detail and depth?</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Suitability for LCOGT's unique capabilities</dt>\r\n\t<dd>Does the proposed study take advantage of the unique aspects of the LCOGT network? Will this project demonstrate a result that could not be obtained without LCOGT?</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Resources brought by other collaborators</dt>\r\n\t<dd>Whille we want to encourage collaboration within the group of institutions that have worked together to make the LCOGT network a reality, we also want the burden of carrying out large projects like these to be shared fairly. We expect that any institution that participates in a key project will demonstrate a commitment to such a significant effort. We imagine a wide range of different types of resources may be relevant, and we leave it to proposers to be creative.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p>In addition to their ranking, the TAC will make a recommendation to the LCOGT Director, who will allocate the LCOGT time, based on the TAC recommendation as well as programmatic considerations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"messages warning\"><strong>Announcement of successful new key projects &nbsp;will be made by March 9, 2015.</strong></p>\r\n<h3>INFORMATION/TOOLS FOR WRITING PROPOSALS</h3>\r\n<p>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/proposal/guidelines\">Guidelines for Writing Proposals page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Information about the capabilities of the instruments can be found on our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/instruments\">instrumentation page</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Exposure Times</h4>\r\n<p>In order to calculate exposure times with our imagers, use the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/files/lco_etc/etc_demo_embedded.html\">exposure time calculator</a>. &nbsp;For FLOYDS, see the table on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/instruments/floyds\">FLOYDS description page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>Visibility Tool</h4>\r\n<p>We have also provided a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/visibility\">visibility tool</a>&nbsp;to show how observable a given RA and Dec. are on the LCOGT network in 2 different ways: seasonal visibility, and daily visibility.</p>\r\n<h4>Observation Overheads</h4>\r\n<p>Time charged includes all the overhead associated with slewing the telescope, acquiring the target, preparing the instrument, and reading out the detector, in addition to the actual exposure time. &nbsp;Proposers should estimate the total amount of time needed for their program (queue-scheduled and target-of-opportunity separately). &nbsp;To assist in this, use the overhead information in the table on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observatory/proposal/guidelines\">Guidelines for Writing Proposals page</a>. &nbsp;For each new object use the Slew &amp; Settle time and the Acquisition &amp; Setup time appropriate for the telescope and instrument you are using. &nbsp;Add the readout time for each separate exposure.</p>\r\n<h3>PROPOSAL PRIORITY</h3>\r\n<p>Our goal in this semester of full science operations for the integrated LCOGT network is to execute all observation requests. &nbsp;TAC priority will be used to guide choices, all other things being equal. &nbsp;Targets-of-opportunity (see below) will have a higher priority than other observations, so we ask proposers to justify their need for that mode.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: 'Century Gothic', sans-serif; font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;\">How do I apply?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">We have a new web-page-based&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://lcogt.net/observe/proposal/create/\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">proposal form</a><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">. &nbsp;Please note that the regular (non key project) call for proposals is active also, and make sure that you specify that you are submitting a key project proposal. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>To submit the proposal, you will need to register at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lcogt.net/observe/auth/accounts/login/?next=http%3A//lcogt.net/observe/proposal/\">proposal portal</a>, and then follow the Create or Edit Proposals link.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of observation</h2>\r\n<p>We are supporting two types of observations: queue-scheduled and target of opportunity (ToO). &nbsp;Queue-scheduled observations are sequences of one or more \"blocks\", defined by a single window (for one) or a cadence (for more than one). &nbsp;A block is a set of integrations, intended to be executed contiguously. &nbsp;A block may be several identical exposures or it may involve filter changes, exposure time changes, or slight changes in position (dithers). &nbsp;A ToO observation is one intended to take place as quickly as possible (within 15 minutes of its availability). &nbsp;Execution of a ToO generally requires the termination of an ongoing queue-scheduled block.</p>\r\n<p>We ask proposers to justify the need for ToO observations and to separate their time request into hours needed for each type. &nbsp;These will be charged separately.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"messages warning\">Note that our definition of a Target of Opportunity (above) is different from the usual one.</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>For any proposal that has special scheduling constraints (e.g., simultaneous observations by two telescopes, multi-night or multi-site timeseries), proposers are&nbsp;<em>strongly</em>&nbsp;advised to contact LCOGT personnel for advice on feasibility before submission.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>Requesting Observations</h2>\r\n<p>Both queue-scheduled and target-of-opportunity observations may be requested either through the web interface or through an API. The web interface allows you to manually describe the observation parameters and constraints, including target position, maximum acceptable airmass, and exposure time. &nbsp;It also allows you to define a sequence of exposures with a specific cadence and jitter. &nbsp;The web page provides feedback about whether the request is schedulable. &nbsp;The API allows the user to input all the information allowed by the form plus some additional parameters. &nbsp;It can also be triggered by an external event. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Data Access</h2>\r\n<p>Pipeline reduced data may be searched and downloaded through the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lcogtarchive.ipac.caltech.edu\">LCOGT data archive at IPAC</a>. &nbsp;Data are typically available in the archive by six hours following the end of the night at each telescope. &nbsp;In cases where quicker access to the data is scientifically justified, arrangements can be made to download \"quick-reduced\" data directly from LCOGT.</p>\r\n<p>Science data has a default proprietary period of 12 months from the time of a given observation. &nbsp;Data that has reached the end of its proprietary period is accessible from the LCOGT data archive at IPAC.</p>\r\n<h2>Time charging policy</h2>\r\n<p>Time is charged for all exposures attempted, regardless of the quality or delivery of the data. &nbsp;Time charged includes the time to slew to your target, the time to get the instrument ready to begin your exposure, the open-shutter time, and the time to readout the detector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ToO observations will be charged once triggered, regardless of the quality or delivery of the data.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The web-based observation request page will provide feedback on the number of hours of the approved allocation that have been used.</p>\r\n<hr>",
