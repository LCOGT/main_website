The question of what could be done to prevent/mitigate similar impacts by small asteroids has been asked loudly, and deserves an answer.&nbsp;</span></p><p>A network of comparatively small telescopes (1 m class) can be compliant with the requirements of a Wide Survey for Near Earth Objects, with the capability of mitigating 50% of the immediate impacts, even from objects as small a 20 m diameter, from the very start of the survey; this percentage grows as the survey progresses.</p><p>The technical implications of the requirement for full sky coverage in every night, with capability of discovering moving objects, will be discussed. We have found that what is required is an innovative telescope, with a field of view not accessible with conventional telescope designs. Such a design exists and is based on the concept of fly-eye, that is separate focal planes. The challenge of manifacturing such telescope, and the equally relevant challenges of data processing, in particular under the condition of remote operations, are discussed.</p><p>I will also discuss the possible additional usages of the same innovative optics for other surveys, and the possibility/opportunity of sharing the same images for different astronomical projects.</p>",

Currently, most spatially unresolved, scattered light experiments focus on nearly edge-on, transiting systems. The temporal changes that occur during planetary occultations are used to suppress systematic errors that would otherwise overwhelm the planetary signal. However, linear polarimetry also has the potential to detect scattered light from exoplanets. This is because the polarization state of light scattered by a planetary atmosphere distinguishes it from both the direct light from the host star and the Wien tail of thermal re-radiation from the planet. Scattered flux should be identifiable regardless of orbital inclination, because both degree and position angle of polarization are modulated continuously throughout the orbit. Orbital inclination, mean number of scattering events, and scattering particle size and index of refraction are discernable with polarimetry. The discovery of spherical droplets of sulfuric acid suspended in the Venusian atmosphere was made with multi-wavelength polarimetry 40 years ago, and technology has matured to the point where such discoveries are now possible for spatially unresolved exoplanets. We will report on the search for scattered light from known exoplanets in B band using the POLISH2 polarimeter on the Lick 3-m telescope. This instrument simultaneously measures all four Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, and V), and it achieves precision within 2.0 times the photon shot noise limit over an entire observing run. The POLISH2 polarimeter is therefore ideally suited for direct detection of spatially unresolved exoplanets.

The ISM in conjunction with transmitter/receiver motion determine the coherence time and coherence bandwidth of the channel, and the concept of an interstellar coherence hole (ICH) is introduced.

Based on statistical techniques resembling thermodynamics, communication is subject to a fundamental lower limit on delivered energy per bit subject to reliable extraction of information. We have shown that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the only fundamental limitation on delivered energy per bit, as the remaining impairments can be circumvented by appropriate signal design (including making use of the ICH) and technology.

Using only Kepler data and the stellar effective temperature from the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), the latest version of my exoplanet fitting software, EXOFAST, typically derives a constraint on the stellar surface gravity exceeding the precision of the KIC by a factor of three and, in some cases, up to a factor of 15. My analysis reduces the uncertainties in the fundamental planet parameters by similar factors, is in agreement with asteroseismic results, simultaneously constrains the planetary eccentricity, and derives a more complete list of system properties with MCMC-derived uncertainties, all while greatly reducing the need for expensive follow-up observations. Finally, I will discuss NRES, the Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs, which I am building at the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope. When completed in 2015, I will use it to get measure the logg for many KOIs.

The associated radiative output and magnetized plasma outflow (solar wind) dominates the local space environment of solar system planets, including Earth, particularly during flares and CMEs. Radio observations are a powerful trace of these phenomena, both through the radio bursts produced during flares and CMEs and the low frequency auroral radio emission produced by magnetized planets experiencing magnetic storms, the latter a key diagnostic for the presence and strength of planetary magnetic fields.</p><p>I will talk about new experiments at Caltech&#39;s Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), dedicated to the detection of such space weather on nearby stellar and planetary systems. These includes the Starburst program, dedicated to the detection and imaging of coronal mass ejections on nearby stars, and the Long Wavelength Array, which aims to detect the auroral radio emissions from nearby exoplanets. The latter is particularly innovative, consisting of 288 antennas, combined to image the entire viewable sky every second from 25-85 MHz. This facility recently saw first light and is currently aiming to provide the first measurement of magnetic fields on extrasolar planets.

The associated radiative output and magnetized plasma outflow (solar wind) dominates the local space environment of solar system planets, including Earth, particularly during flares and CMEs. Radio observations are a powerful trace of these phenomena, both through the radio bursts produced during flares and CMEs and the low frequency auroral radio emission produced by magnetized planets experiencing magnetic storms, the latter a key diagnostic for the presence and strength of planetary magnetic fields.</p><p>I will talk about new experiments at Caltech&#39;s Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), dedicated to the detection of such space weather on nearby stellar and planetary systems. These includes the Starburst program, dedicated to the detection and imaging of coronal mass ejections on nearby stars, and the Long Wavelength Array, which aims to detect the auroral radio emissions from nearby exoplanets.

Transiting planets are key to understanding the atmospheres, composition, and dynamics of exoplanets. In this talk, I will describe some of the exoplanet characterisation studies that we have undertaken, using both ground-based eclipse observations and Kepler transit photometry.</p><p>I will introduce the Anglo-Australian Telescope survey of hot-Jupiter eclipses, a new survey we are undertaking to measure the infrared, multi-band secondary eclipses for a large number of southern hot-Jupiters. These observations are providing a set of temperatures and colours to characterise the most irradiated hot-Jupiters. I will also describe our modelling of Kepler transit light curves. We show that we can measure the spin-orbit alignment for very long period planets orbiting gravity-darkened stars. We can also measure the shapes of the planets themselves, and search for rapidly rotating, oblate planets observed by Kepler.</p>",
