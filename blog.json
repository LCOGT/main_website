In June 2008 we were able to see the first blanks at the Hextek workshop. We expect about one set of mirror blanks each month from now on. The mirrors are initially fused flat, with cylindrical glass tubes separating the top and bottom glass plates. Hextek provide mirror blanks which are as stiff as solid blanks of the same size, but much lighter - each primary weighs 160 lbs, each secondary weighs 12 lbs.  There are 108 cells in the 1-meter blank which is 7 inch thick. The blanks have also been heated and slumped so the front surface is close to a sphere that best matches the desired curvature of the final mirror.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe secondary has 48 cells and is 13 inch diameter by 2 inch thick. Each cell pocket has a hole through the non-reflecting surface that allows airflow across and inside the mirror. The large ratio of surface area to mass allows the glass to quickly cool to ambient air-temperature, and thus avoids image degradation that could be caused by mirrors remaining hot from daytime heating.   \r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n[[{\u0022attributes\u0022: {\u0022alt\u0022: \u0022M2-front-tilted_s.jpg\u0022, \u0022style\u0022: \u0022float: right; height: 143px; width: 184px; \u0022, \u0022class\u0022: \u0022media-image large imagecache\u0022, \u0022rel\u0022: \u0022imagecache\u0022, \u0022typeof\u0022: \u0022foaf:Image\u0022}, \u0022view_mode\u0022: \u0022media_large\u0022, \u0022type\u0022: \u0022media\u0022, \u0022fid\u0022: \u0022202\u0022}]] \r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EPolishing\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nIn July 2008 we signed a contract with Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory to polish the 1-meter optics.

In June 2008 we were able to see the first blanks at the Hextek workshop. We expect about one set of mirror blanks each month from now on. The mirrors are initially fused flat, with cylindrical glass tubes separating the top and bottom glass plates. Hextek provide mirror blanks which are as stiff as solid blanks of the same size, but much lighter - each primary weighs 160 lbs, each secondary weighs 12 lbs.  There are 108 cells in the 1-meter blank which is 7 inch thick. The blanks have also been heated and slumped so the front surface is close to a sphere that best matches the desired curvature of the final mirror.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe secondary has 48 cells and is 13 inch diameter by 2 inch thick. Each cell pocket has a hole through the non-reflecting surface that allows airflow across and inside the mirror. The large ratio of surface area to mass allows the glass to quickly cool to ambient air-temperature, and thus avoids image degradation that could be caused by mirrors remaining hot from daytime heating.   \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan id=\u0022styles-1-0\u0022 class=\u0022styles file-styles fourcol_image\u0022\u003E  \u003Cimg width=\u0022184\u0022 height=\u0022143\u0022 class=\u0022media-image large imagecache\u0022 style=\u0022float: right; height: 143px; width: 184px; ;\u0022 id=\u00221\u0022 typeof=\u0022foaf:Image\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/default\/files\/styles\/fourcol-image\/public\/egomez\/M2-front-tilted_s.jpg?itok=Nn1EA7O3\u0022 alt=\u0022M2-front-tilted_s.jpg\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPolishing\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn July 2008 we signed a contract with Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory to polish the 1-meter optics.

The neutron star is called a pulsar because the star is spinning thirty times a second, throwing out energy to power the nebula.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOlivia searched through the Faulkes image archive for images of the Crab and obtained a number of good quality images that had been taken through the red filter with FTN. After aligning all of the images, she created an animation showing the changes of the nebula over time. The animation spans over 2 and a half years and clearly shows at least three distinct shock-waves moving outwards (see the red arrow in the image below) in the inner region, these are known as the \u0022toroidal wisps\u0022. These wisps are thought to be caused by the pulsar throwing out energy which then interacts with the nebula.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the position of the shock waves in each image (labeled in red), Olivia estimated the velocity of the closest shock wave, finding an outwards velocity of about 24,000 km\/s which is 8% of the speed of light! Although this seems unbelievably fast, Olivia\u0027s calculation agrees with similar studies looking at the velocity of these wisps at X-ray and radio wavelengths.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E  \u003Cimg class=\u0022media-image\u0022 id=\u00221\u0022 typeof=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/default\/files\/styles\/fourcol-image\/public\/egomez\/crab2.jpg?itok=Lz12oqJR\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOlivia provided all of the images for this article.

Since the beginning it is connected with Nicholas Copernicus University and other institutions in our region, which during 4 days prepare more than 150 (this year almost 170) events covering around 40 science and art disciplines. It is very popular not only among our town\u0027s inhabitants, some people come to visit our town during these days to have also an opportunity to see something interesting (total number of visitors of all the events is estimated to around 30 000). This year we have had a special contribution from astronomy (due to \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/astronomy2009.org\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EIYA 2009\u003C\/a\u003E), which was present during main festival events.

The events called \u0026quot;Night sky at the antipodes\u0026quot; took place on Thursday and Friday nights and gathered around 100 visitors each day.

It is very simple to use and will give you suggestions for objects to observe in seconds. You need to select your observing location (one of the LCOGT sites across the globe), the time and date of your observations and you can click submit. You can limit what the search returns to Extra-solar planets, supernovae, asteroids, or guided tours of the sky or leave the default setting to see visible objects from all of the categories.

Below that is the exposure time, whichautomatically adjusts to the light level, meaning that we can also usethe camera during the day time.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome features to note are: the brightness of the sky (the brightobject tracking across the sky is the Moon not the Sun!); FaulkesTelescope North in the top right corner, carrying on with its nightlyobservations; the clouds which quickly appear at 12:31 (note that FTNhas automatically closed); and last but not least, the Milky Way isvisible right at the end of the night, once the Moon has set.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will be making the current image the camera has taken and a movieof the night to the current time available, every night. There are someglitches in the system which need to be worked out (like the purpleframes). Watch this space!\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Mark Elphick (FTN observatory manager) for installing the camera. Here is a new view of the night sky on the night of 7 Sept 2009. Sadly FTN spend most the night looking through the clouds!\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gU3xvxR9V_8?rel=0\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E ",

However, these two galaxies are in a region of sky where there happens to be a lot of dust from our own Galaxy in front.\u00a0 This means that we are also looking through the debris in our own Galaxy, and as you can see from the \u0026quot;wispy\u0026quot; image above, there are places where space is filled with lots of dusty filaments.\u00a0 The material in the north may actually be in our own Galaxy and not associated with M81 so this needs further checking to be sure. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGalaxies galore\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe can also use Herschel to look deep into space and see distant galaxies which were around when the Universe was very young, when the Universe was about a third to a tenth of its present day age.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this image we are literally detecting thousands of galaxies.\u00a0 One of the really surprising things we\u0027ve learnt with Herschel, is that we see so many sources like this in the background of our images, far more than we expected.\u00a0 The colours in this image give an idea how distant the galaxies are.\u00a0 \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EComplex chemistry \u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHerschel has not just been busy taking images, it has also used its numerous spectrographs to search for molecules and atoms in galaxies, stars and comets.\u00a0 One example is the spectra of the famous galaxy Arp220 shown here, which is the result of two giant galaxies merging together.\u00a0\u00a0 Arp 220 is around 250 million light years away and is undergoing a renewed (and active) period of star formation as a result of the merger which has comrpessed and heated the gas.\u00a0\u00a0 Arp 220 is an important \u0026quot;laboratory\u0026quot; for astronomers to test theories on what the first few generations of galaxies would look like.\u00a0 What we see in this spectrum are emission and absorption features of water and carbon monoxide.\u00a0 Herschel is the first instrument to allow us to look at spectra in the submillimetre wavebands and the wealth of information it tells us is outstanding.\u00a0 Not only can we detect water (seen for the first time in emission here), but we can figure out what its temperature and density is.\u00a0 The latest spectra of the massive giant star VY Majoris shows evidence for hot steam, which is cooling the star in the same way we use steam to cool nuclear reactors in power stations!

However, these two galaxies are in a region of sky where there happens to be a lot of dust from our own Galaxy in front.\u00a0 This means that we are also looking through the debris in our own Galaxy, and as you can see from the \u0022wispy\u0022 image above, there are places where space is filled with lots of dusty filaments.\u00a0 The material in the north may actually be in our own Galaxy and not associated with M81 so this needs further checking to be sure. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGalaxies galore\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe can also use Herschel to look deep into space and see distant galaxies which were around when the Universe was very young, when the Universe was about a third to a tenth of its present day age.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this image we are literally detecting thousands of galaxies.\u00a0 One of the really surprising things we\u0027ve learnt with Herschel, is that we see so many sources like this in the background of our images, far more than we expected.\u00a0 The colours in this image give an idea how distant the galaxies are.\u00a0 \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EComplex chemistry \u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHerschel has not just been busy taking images, it has also used its numerous spectrographs to search for molecules and atoms in galaxies, stars and comets.\u00a0 One example is the spectra of the famous galaxy Arp220 shown here, which is the result of two giant galaxies merging together.\u00a0\u00a0 Arp 220 is around 250 million light years away and is undergoing a renewed (and active) period of star formation as a result of the merger which has comrpessed and heated the gas.\u00a0\u00a0 Arp 220 is an important \u0022laboratory\u0022 for astronomers to test theories on what the first few generations of galaxies would look like.\u00a0 What we see in this spectrum are emission and absorption features of water and carbon monoxide.\u00a0 Herschel is the first instrument to allow us to look at spectra in the submillimetre wavebands and the wealth of information it tells us is outstanding.\u00a0 Not only can we detect water (seen for the first time in emission here), but we can figure out what its temperature and density is.\u00a0 The latest spectra of the massive giant star VY Majoris shows evidence for hot steam, which is cooling the star in the same way we use steam to cool nuclear reactors in power stations!

This introduces an extra flexibility into the 3 piers that each telescope will rest on, as their height also has to be increased.

More than 400 exoplanets have been discovered so far, 70 of them through the transit method. A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star\u2019s light. This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet\u2019s mass, diameter, density and temperature to be deduced. The fact that CoRoT-9b takes 95 Earth days to orbit its star demonstrates the usefulness of Space observations in finding planets with long orbital periods, a very difficult task when observing from the ground. Indeed, its period is about 10 times longer than that of any planet previously discovered by the transit method.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe CoRoT satellite identified the planet after 150 days of continuous observations during the Summer of 2008. Due to the nature of CoRoT measurements, any detection requires verification using ground-based telescopes. This was done by the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\/faulkes-telescope-north\u0022\u003EFaulkes Telescope North\u003C\/a\u003E  (FTN), located on Mt. \u003Ca href=\u0022\/site\/haleakala\u0022\u003EHaleakala\u003C\/a\u003E  on the Hawaiian island of Maui. FTN is a 2 meter telescope, part of the LCOGT network. \u201cSince a transit occurs only once every 95 days, FTN was at the right place at the right time to observe the transit on September 2009, thereby confirming the CoRoT detection\u201d, says Dr. Tim Lister, who carried out the FTN observations, in collaboration with other telescopes across the globe.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe astronomical community has been looking during the last decade for a transiting extra-solar planet with a \u0026quot;pure, isolated\u0026quot; history of evolution, without the contamination and interference of its parent star.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\u201cThe new planet keeps a relatively large distance from its central star, similar to\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nthe orbit of Mercury around the Sun.\u201d says Dr. Avi Shporer, \u201cpermitting the application of\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nplanetary evolution models without corrections, as have been needed with other transiting\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nplanets, orbiting their parent stars in close-in orbits, with a typical orbital period of under a\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nweek.\u201d The planet is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, but it may contain up to 20 Earth\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nmasses of heavier elements including rock and water under high pressure. It is thus very similar\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nto the Solar System\u2019s giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe international team of astronomers participating in the discovery notes that while temperate\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\ngas giants are so far the largest known group of planets, CoRoT-9b is the first transiting planet\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nof this kind. The discovery will lead to a better understanding of such commonly occurring\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nplanets and open up a new field of research to understand the atmospheres of moderate- and\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nlow-temperature planets.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nFor more information please see the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.eso.org\/public\/news\/eso1011\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eofficial ESO press release\u003C\/a\u003E. \r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n",

The parameters of this gas giant, which has features in common with the majority of exoplanets discovered so far, represents a valuable standard model when it comes to identifying new Jovian-type bodies with moderate temperatures.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis European-led discovery has involved 60 astronomers worldwide, including LCOGT and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.physics.ucsb.edu\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EUCSB\u003C\/a\u003E scientists Drs.\u003Ca href=\u0022\/user\/tlister\u0022\u003E Tim Lister\u003C\/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022\/user\/rstreet\u0022\u003ERachel Street\u003C\/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022\/user\/mhidas\u0022\u003EMarton Hidas,\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022\/user\/ashporer\u0022\u003EAvi Shporer\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u201cCoRoT-9b is the first transiting exoplanet that is definitely similar to a planet in our Solar System.\u201d says Dr. Marton Hidas. \u201cWhat\u2019s special about this planet is that compared to other transiting planets it is a temperate planet,\u201d explains Dr. Rachel Street, \u201cwith great potential for future studies concerning its physical characteristics and atmosphere.\u201d\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nAnalysis of the planet\u2019s transits has provided more information on CoRoT-9b than for other exoplanets of the same type. More than 400 exoplanets have been discovered so far, 70 of them through the transit method. A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star\u2019s light. This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet\u2019s mass, diameter, density and temperature to be deduced. The fact that CoRoT-9b takes 95 Earth days to orbit its star demonstrates the usefulness of Space observations in finding planets with long orbital periods, a very difficult task when observing from the ground. Indeed, its period is about 10 times longer than that of any planet previously discovered by the transit method.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe CoRoT satellite identified the planet after 150 days of continuous observations during the Summer of 2008. Due to the nature of CoRoT measurements, any detection requires verification using ground-based telescopes. This was done by the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\/faulkes-telescope-north\u0022\u003EFaulkes Telescope North\u003C\/a\u003E  (FTN), located on Mt. \u003Ca href=\u0022\/site\/haleakala\u0022\u003EHaleakala\u003C\/a\u003E  on the Hawaiian island of Maui. FTN is a 2 meter telescope, part of the LCOGT network. \u201cSince a transit occurs only once every 95 days, FTN was at the right place at the right time to observe the transit on September 2009, thereby confirming the CoRoT detection\u201d, says Dr. Tim Lister, who carried out the FTN observations, in collaboration with other telescopes across the globe.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe astronomical community has been looking during the last decade for a transiting extra-solar planet with a \u0022pure, isolated\u0022 history of evolution, without the contamination and interference of its parent star.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201cThe new planet keeps a relatively large distance from its central star, similar to\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nthe orbit of Mercury around the Sun.\u201d says Dr. Avi Shporer, \u201cpermitting the application of\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nplanetary evolution models without corrections, as have been needed with other transiting\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nplanets, orbiting their parent stars in close-in orbits, with a typical orbital period of under a\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nweek.\u201d The planet is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, but it may contain up to 20 Earth\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nmasses of heavier elements including rock and water under high pressure. It is thus very similar\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nto the Solar System\u2019s giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe international team of astronomers participating in the discovery notes that while temperate\u003Cbr \/\u003E\ngas giants are so far the largest known group of planets, CoRoT-9b is the first transiting planet\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nof this kind. The discovery will lead to a better understanding of such commonly occurring\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nplanets and open up a new field of research to understand the atmospheres of moderate- and\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nlow-temperature planets.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor more information please see the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.eso.org\/public\/news\/eso1011\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eofficial ESO press release\u003C\/a\u003E. \n\u003C\/p\u003E",

This upsets the primary theory of how planets are formed. The planets are called \u201cexoplanets\u201d because they are located outside of our solar system.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThese and other related discoveries are being presented at the UK National Astronomy Meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, this week. This is the first public mention of the new planets and the research will be described in upcoming scientific journal articles.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\n\u201cPlanet evolution theorists now have to explain how so many planets came to be orbiting like this,\u201d said Tim Lister, a project scientist at LCOGT. Lister leads a major part of the observational campaigns along with Rachel Street of LCOGT, Andrew Cameron of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and Didier Queloz, of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nData from LCOGT was instrumental in confirming the new planet discoveries. By adding these nine new \u201ctransiting\u201d planets, the number of known transiting planets has grown from 71 to 80. A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star\u0027s light. This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet\u0027s mass, diameter, density, and temperature to be deduced.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nAfter the initial detection of the new exoplanets by the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.superwasp.org\/\u0022\u003EWide Angle Search for Planets\u003C\/a\u003E (WASP), the team of astronomers combined data from LCOGT\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\u0022\u003E2.0-meter Faulkes Telescopes\u003C\/a\u003E  in \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\/faulkes-telescope-north\u0022\u003EHawaii \u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\/faulkes-telescope-south\u0022\u003EAustralia\u003C\/a\u003E  with follow-up from other telescopes to confirm the discoveries and characterize the planets.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe planets are revolving around nearby stars within 1,000 light years of our galaxy. Their stars are located in the constellations Pegasus, Virgo, Pisces, and Andromeda, in the northern hemisphere, and Eridanus, Hydra, Cetus, and Phoenix, in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe nine planets are called \u201cHot Jupiters.\u201d The planets are orbiting other stars that have masses similar to that of Jupiter, but they orbit their parent stars much more closely than any of the planets in our solar system. In the 15 years since the first Hot Jupiters were discovered, their origin has been a puzzle. Because they are both large and close, they are easier to detect from their gravitational effect on their stars and more likely to transit the disk of the star. Most of the first exoplanets that were discovered were of this type.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe cores of giant planets are thought to form from a mix of rock and ice particles found only in the cold outer reaches of planetary systems. Hot Jupiters, therefore, must form far from their star and subsequently migrate inwards over the course of a few million years. Many astronomers believed this could happen due to gravitational interactions with the disk of dust from which they formed, and which might also subsequently form Earth-like rocky planets. However, these new results suggest this may not be the whole story because it does not explain how planets end up orbiting contrary to the orbit of the disk.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe best alternative migration theory suggests that the proximity of Hot Jupiters to their stars is not due to interactions with the dust disk at all, but to a slower evolution involving a gravitational tug-of-war with more distant planetary or stellar companions over hundreds of millions of years, according to the research team. Bounced onto a tilted and elongated orbit, a wandering gas giant would suffer tidal friction every time it swung close to the star, eventually becoming parked in a near circular, but randomly tilted orbit close to the star. \u201cIn this scenario, smaller planets in orbits similar to Earth\u0027s are unlikely to survive,\u201d said Rachel Street.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nLCOGT\u0027s flexible approach to scheduling means the network provides responsive and highly efficient follow-up for large-scale surveys such as WASP.

            "safe_value": "\u003Cp\u003E\nThe discovery of nine new planets challenges the reigning theory of the formation of planets, according to new observations by astronomers, 2 of which for our own \u003Ca href=\u0022\/user\/rstreet\u0022\u003EDr Rachel Street\u003C\/a\u003E  and \u003Ca href=\u0022\/user\/tlister\u0022\u003EDr Tim Lister\u003C\/a\u003E .\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike the planets in our solar system, two of the newly discovered planets are orbiting in the opposite direction to the rotation of their host star. This upsets the primary theory of how planets are formed. The planets are called \u201cexoplanets\u201d because they are located outside of our solar system.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese and other related discoveries are being presented at the UK National Astronomy Meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, this week. This is the first public mention of the new planets and the research will be described in upcoming scientific journal articles.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201cPlanet evolution theorists now have to explain how so many planets came to be orbiting like this,\u201d said Tim Lister, a project scientist at LCOGT. Lister leads a major part of the observational campaigns along with Rachel Street of LCOGT, Andrew Cameron of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and Didier Queloz, of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nData from LCOGT was instrumental in confirming the new planet discoveries. By adding these nine new \u201ctransiting\u201d planets, the number of known transiting planets has grown from 71 to 80. A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star\u0027s light. This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet\u0027s mass, diameter, density, and temperature to be deduced.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the initial detection of the new exoplanets by the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.superwasp.org\/\u0022\u003EWide Angle Search for Planets\u003C\/a\u003E (WASP), the team of astronomers combined data from LCOGT\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\u0022\u003E2.0-meter Faulkes Telescopes\u003C\/a\u003E  in \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\/faulkes-telescope-north\u0022\u003EHawaii \u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022\/network\/2m\/faulkes-telescope-south\u0022\u003EAustralia\u003C\/a\u003E  with follow-up from other telescopes to confirm the discoveries and characterize the planets.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planets are revolving around nearby stars within 1,000 light years of our galaxy. Their stars are located in the constellations Pegasus, Virgo, Pisces, and Andromeda, in the northern hemisphere, and Eridanus, Hydra, Cetus, and Phoenix, in the southern hemisphere.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nine planets are called \u201cHot Jupiters.\u201d The planets are orbiting other stars that have masses similar to that of Jupiter, but they orbit their parent stars much more closely than any of the planets in our solar system. In the 15 years since the first Hot Jupiters were discovered, their origin has been a puzzle. Because they are both large and close, they are easier to detect from their gravitational effect on their stars and more likely to transit the disk of the star. Most of the first exoplanets that were discovered were of this type.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cores of giant planets are thought to form from a mix of rock and ice particles found only in the cold outer reaches of planetary systems. Hot Jupiters, therefore, must form far from their star and subsequently migrate inwards over the course of a few million years. Many astronomers believed this could happen due to gravitational interactions with the disk of dust from which they formed, and which might also subsequently form Earth-like rocky planets. However, these new results suggest this may not be the whole story because it does not explain how planets end up orbiting contrary to the orbit of the disk.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best alternative migration theory suggests that the proximity of Hot Jupiters to their stars is not due to interactions with the dust disk at all, but to a slower evolution involving a gravitational tug-of-war with more distant planetary or stellar companions over hundreds of millions of years, according to the research team. Bounced onto a tilted and elongated orbit, a wandering gas giant would suffer tidal friction every time it swung close to the star, eventually becoming parked in a near circular, but randomly tilted orbit close to the star. \u201cIn this scenario, smaller planets in orbits similar to Earth\u0027s are unlikely to survive,\u201d said Rachel Street.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLCOGT\u0027s flexible approach to scheduling means the network provides responsive and highly efficient follow-up for large-scale surveys such as WASP.

Here are latest photos from Enrique (who is project managing the ground work for us in Chile). This might not look like much but it represents a significant advance in the readiness of the site to house telescopes.

This further supports the idea that it is man-made.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichard believes it could be the 4th stage of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Proton_rocket\u0022\u003ERussian Proton rocket\u003C\/a\u003E which launched the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Luna_23\u0022\u003ELuna 23 \u003C\/a\u003Elunar sample return attempt.\u00a0 The lunar probe was launched on 1974 October 28 and reached lunar orbit on 1974 November 2. \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/unicorn.eis.uva.es\/neodys\/\u0022\u003ENEODyS\u003C\/a\u003E (which you can use estimate the orbital path of Near Earth Objects) has the closest approach to the Earth of 2010 KQ on 1974 November 5 at 0.000027 AU according to yesterday\u0027s NEODyS orbit update.\u00a0 The 4th stage would have been the Block D or possibly the Block DM stage equipped with an 11D-58S engine.\u00a0 It was 5.7 meters in length.\u00a0 Strangely, the latest astrometry from yesterday has changed the orbit solution a little and the 1974 Nov 5 approach has been removed.\u00a0 Since the empty booster is very low mass compared to its size, effects not related to the gravitational pull of the Sun and other planets (such as solar radiation pressure) can make exact calculations very difficult.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe look forward to hearing more from Richard about the progress of this strange looking object.

Situated in the darkest county in Texas, McDonald sits in the Davis Mountains 440 miles west of the University campus and 200 miles southeast of Juarez, Mexico. The telescopes on site range from the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly telescope to a 0.8m telescope and support a wide spectrum of astronomical studies. The WMAT fulfills the role of a publicly-available, eyepiece telescope on the popular site.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EOne impetus for the redesign and rededication of this telescope has been the demand for telescope access for mobility impaired or completely wheelchair bound individuals. The Observatory Visitor\u2019s Center receives 60,000 visitors a year, many for the Observatory\u2019s popular Star Parties.

When the flat steering mirror is pointed towards the south with the observer to the north, the observer can see the southern sky quadrant. The northern quadrant becomes visible by rotating the flat mirror and eyepiece assembly 180\u00ba.\u00a0This movable flat mirror allows the telescope to slew quickly to numerous targets in rapid succession while the eyepiece remains fixed.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EAfter an extensive tear-down, redesign, and rebuild conducted at LCOGT\u2019s Goleta, California headquarters, LCOGT engineers began on-site mechanical assembly of the WMAT in late June of 2009.

It contains two 18-inch, f\/8 primary mirrors and a 24-inch diameter control mirror.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EWayne Rosing and several LCOGT engineers have been on-site completing final commissioning and upgrades for the telescope in the hours leading up to the dedication.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EThe dedication ceremony, to be attended by Rosing, LCOGTpersonnel, and officials from the University of Texas, Austin and their Astronomy Program, commences in daylight on the afternoon of the 17\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E. Festivities will spill into the night as the telescope is put to use in the dark skies above the Davis Mountains of Texas.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch4\u003EHuman-Engineering Design\u003C\/h4\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EMcDonald Observatory is the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Astronomy Department\u0027s facility. Situated in the darkest county in Texas, McDonald sits in the Davis Mountains 440 miles west of the University campus and 200 miles southeast of Juarez, Mexico. The telescopes on site range from the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly telescope to a 0.8m telescope and support a wide spectrum of astronomical studies. The WMAT fulfills the role of a publicly-available, eyepiece telescope on the popular site.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EOne impetus for the redesign and rededication of this telescope has been the demand for telescope access for mobility impaired or completely wheelchair bound individuals. The Observatory Visitor\u2019s Center receives 60,000 visitors a year, many for the Observatory\u2019s popular Star Parties. The redesigned telescope and viewing area ensures that nearly everyone who visits will be able to observe astronomical targets.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ca name=\u0022WMAT at sunset\u0022 title=\u0022WMAT at sunset\u0022 id=\u0022WMAT at sunset\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EThe revised design includes two 18\u201d (0.46m) primary mirrors aligned north-south with a steering flat mirror centered between them to allow easier, quicker access to the entire sky. When the flat steering mirror is pointed towards the south with the observer to the north, the observer can see the southern sky quadrant. The northern quadrant becomes visible by rotating the flat mirror and eyepiece assembly 180\u00ba.\u00a0This movable flat mirror allows the telescope to slew quickly to numerous targets in rapid succession while the eyepiece remains fixed.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EAfter an extensive tear-down, redesign, and rebuild conducted at LCOGT\u2019s Goleta, California headquarters, LCOGT engineers began on-site mechanical assembly of the WMAT in late June of 2009. LCOGT software engineers arrived the following week to begin the process of installing and refining the operational controls.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EWorking on the telescope during one of the Observatory\u2019s monthly Star Parties, the LCOGT engineering crew decided to test the \u201cDeathStar\u201d manual pointing procedure using an extremely bright hand-held laser. The effect in the dark of night is captivating and soon the entire 300-participant Star Party had encircled the new telescope.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ca name=\u0022\u201cDeath Star\u201d manual pointing procedure\u0022 title=\u0022\u201cDeath Star\u201d manual pointing procedure\u0022 id=\u0022\u201cDeath Star\u201d manual pointing procedure\u0022\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EIn less than a minute, visitors had formed a line to look through the telescope. First astronomical light for the public was obtained by a 10-year old boy who personally pointed the telescope at the Moon.\u00a0As a direct result of accidentally working the Star Party that night, LCOGT engineers generated numerous telescope improvements, with particular emphasis on how people may better interact\/interface with theinstrument.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003EImages seen through the WMAT are remarkably clear, crisp, and detailed. The unique optical design of the instrument, prime focus viewing with only two reflections and no central obstructions, makes for one of the best instruments available for public viewing of astronomical targets.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003ECommissioning of the WMAT telescope began in July, 2009, following hardware and optics installation. A Telescope Control System (TCS)computer allows the instrument to target and track objects quickly over the entire sky.\u00a0The telescope performed flawlessly throughout Spring Break, 2010, with stunning views available for over 3,000 visitors.\u003C\/p\u003E",

The image on the right is the poster that was presented by Rachel Ross (click to view larger), giving an update on where LCOGT is in terms of building and deploying telescopes and what users can expect to see now and in the future. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn theme that has been running through the last couple years of meetings is using social media to connect users all over the world.\u00a0 With Twitter, Facebook, iPhones, blogs, etc becoming more popular, more groups are using these tools to reach out to communities that they may normally not reach.\u00a0 Want to find a local astronomy club that is part of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov\/index.cfm\u0022\u003ENight Sky Network\u003C\/a\u003E?\u00a0 There is an app for that!\u00a0 How about keeping up with the latest news from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.zooniverse.org\/home\u0022\u003EZooniverse\u003C\/a\u003E project (home to the popular Galaxy Zoo)?\u00a0 Follow their twitter feed!\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith more and more data being collected, the scientists are being overwhelmed and looking for ways to process it in a timely manner. \u00a0 More of these scientists are turning their research into Citizen Science projects, meaning that the data is opened up to a community and they take part in going through it.\u00a0 One of the most popular examples of Citizen Science is Galaxy Zoo, and the rest of the Zooniverse. \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/setiathome.berkeley.edu\/index.php\u0022\u003ESeti@home\u003C\/a\u003E is considered one of the first of the Citizen Science projects, launched in 1999, which uses the publics computers (by use of a special application) to process radio data, looking for certain signatures. With more of these projects popping up, more websites that try to organize them are also coming online.\u00a0 One such example is \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/scienceforcitizens.net\/\u0022\u003EScience for Citizens\u003C\/a\u003E, which hosts a large selection of Citizen Science projects spanning many fields, as well as newsletters, videos, blogs, a Facebook page, Twitter account, and more.\u00a0 I encourage you to check it out, there are 15 projects just in the Astronomy \u0026amp; Space category! \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther topics that were discussed were new activities to do in the classroom, ideas for teaching Astro 101, sharing different projects and ideas for the classroom, planetariums, and outreach events, how to work with the 2012 scare and other misconceptions, and lots more.\u00a0 Check out the ASP website (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/astrosociety.org\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/astrosociety.org\u003C\/a\u003E) for more information about these meetings, groups that you may join, resources, and more.\u00a0 This year\u0027s meeting will be summarized in the 2010 Conference Procedings and will be available for purchase at the ASP\u0027s AstroShop.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd speaking of using social media, check out our \u003Ca href=\u0022#!\/pages\/Las-Cumbres-Observatory-Global-Telescope-Network\/428068665\u0022\u003EFacebook page\u003C\/a\u003E or follow us on \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/twitter.com\/lcogt\u0022\u003ETwitter\u003C\/a\u003E!\n\u003C\/p\u003E",

Librarian Tracy Latimer arranges the events which draw record numbers of people.  \u201c81 attendees, for a school night, is outstanding, and the numbers seem to be growing every time we have one of these programs.\u201d said Latimer.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a brief talk I called the first member out of the audience. \u00a0I never control the telescope at these events. \u00a0It is an opportunity for community members to use a professional grade telescope.  The first telescope operator was a girl about 10 years old, who had a quick hand.  As soon as I had asked who wanted to use the telescope first, her hand shot up, beating several others. Shortly after the telescope began slewing to the first target, \u201cAn Unusual Error\u201d occurred.  I checked the status of the telescope and the rain sensor had begun closing the dome.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter talking with the audience for a few minutes it became apparent the the telescope would not open before our hour of time was up. \u00a0I explained the situation to the audience, and offered that if they wanted to stay I could show them a selection of images taken with the Faulkes Telescope North by students here on Maui, and they could ask me questions. \u00a0 A few people filtered out, but most stayed. \u00a0Question after question and image after image.  Finally the library had to tell people, \u201cOne last question....\u0022\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn spite of the rain at the summit those who attended had a great time.  \u201cWe also had several people come in and want to know when the next astronomy program was scheduled!\u201d said Latimer.  After packing away my equipment, and talking with the librarians for a few minutes I headed out to my car. \u00a0Several people came up to me in the parking lot to say \u201cthanks\u201d. \u00a0Most them turned around got in their cars and drove off.  They had been waiting to say thanks and shake my hand.  That\u0027s the kind of community we have here \u2013 the spirit of Aloha.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E",

We\u0027ve just improved the search tool to make it easier to find your own observations and to browse through the observations of others. As it is now live I thought I\u0027d describe some of the changes and improvements here. \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic \u003Ca href=\u0022\/search\/archive\u0022\u003Earchive search\u003C\/a\u003E contains much the same options as it did before including the ability to search by a particular object name, by telescope, by filter and in a specific date range. However the search form has been cleaned up and is hopefully a little easier to use than it was before; as you go to each part of the form you should see a helpful hint explaining what that section will do. As before, you will probably start off by entering an object name. Once you\u0027ve done that, a background check is made to see if the text you entered is an astronomical object. If it\u0027s a recognised object then the type of object and its position will be displayed below the object name box. If the object doesn\u0027t seem to exist it will say so and if you\u0027ve misspelt the name you may even be offered a spelling suggestion. As before you can still choose the telescope and filter but the date range options have been simplified. The default range is now set to the past 24 hours but you can choose to search over all dates or a specific range.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get into the search results you\u0027ll start to notice the biggest changes. Each page of results now contains many more results than before and they are arranged in a grid to make them easier to glance at by eye. Each item in the grid has the object and observer names underneath it and you can quickly see more information by clicking on the small \u0027i\u0027 circle in the top right of the image. Clicking on the observer name will take you to a search page for their observations.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClicking on one of the thumbnail images in the search results takes you to \u003Ca href=\u0022\/search\/observation\/50956+1+1804\u0022\u003Ethe page for that observation\u003C\/a\u003E. There you\u0027ll get even more information, links to other web resources, and links to the FITS and jpeg images for each filter where available.

We\u0027ve just improved the search tool to make it easier to find your own observations and to browse through the observations of others. As it is now live I thought I\u0027d describe some of the changes and improvements here. \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic \u003Ca href=\u0022\/search\/archive\u0022\u003Earchive search\u003C\/a\u003E contains much the same options as it did before including the ability to search by a particular object name, by telescope, by filter and in a specific date range. However the search form has been cleaned up and is hopefully a little easier to use than it was before; as you go to each part of the form you should see a helpful hint explaining what that section will do. As before, you will probably start off by entering an object name. Once you\u0027ve done that, a background check is made to see if the text you entered is an astronomical object. If it\u0027s a recognised object then the type of object and its position will be displayed below the object name box. If the object doesn\u0027t seem to exist it will say so and if you\u0027ve misspelt the name you may even be offered a spelling suggestion. As before you can still choose the telescope and filter but the date range options have been simplified. The default range is now set to the past 24 hours but you can choose to search over all dates or a specific range.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get into the search results you\u0027ll start to notice the biggest changes. Each page of results now contains many more results than before and they are arranged in a grid to make them easier to glance at by eye. Each item in the grid has the object and observer names underneath it and you can quickly see more information by clicking on the small \u0027i\u0027 circle in the top right of the image. Clicking on the observer name will take you to a search page for their observations.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClicking on one of the thumbnail images in the search results takes you to \u003Ca href=\u0022\/search\/observation\/50956+1+1804\u0022\u003Ethe page for that observation\u003C\/a\u003E. There you\u0027ll get even more information, links to other web resources, and links to the FITS and jpeg images for each filter where available. As an added extra, if you hover your mouse cursor over any of the jpeg file links, the main observation image will be replaced with the image for each filter (pressing r, g or b on your keyboard should give the same effect). To provide a context for the current image on an observation page, you\u0027ll also see the \u0027observation stream\u0027 for that observer underneath the large image. \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith more than 50611 observations to explore, I hope these new features encourage people to browse through the archives and perhaps discover observations that have long been forgotten.

Stating that Dr. Armstrong \u201cis an important guy,\u201d Pfluke described the methodology used to make the observation time available. \u201cWhen people take pictures on the Faulkes, they usually take them just from their laptop\u2026 they just click and the telescope will move over the object you want to image.\u201d\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\n  \u003Cimg width=\u0022296\u0022 height=\u0022450\u0022 class=\u0022media-image medium_large asset_lightbox\u0022 id=\u002215\u0022 typeof=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/default\/files\/styles\/fourcol-image\/public\/dpetry\/PflukeTimes_090510_Page03.JPG?itok=GM55IE4V\u0022 alt=\u0022The Pfluke Times, Sept 5, 2010, Page 4\u0022 \/\u003E\u003Cimg width=\u0022300\u0022 height=\u0022450\u0022 class=\u0022media-image medium_large asset_lightbox\u0022 id=\u002216\u0022 typeof=\u0022Image\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/default\/files\/styles\/fourcol-image\/public\/dpetry\/PflukeTimes_090510_Page08.JPG?itok=PgYebRA4\u0022 alt=\u0022The Pfluke Times, Sept 5, 2010, Page 8\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nThe two Faulkes telescopes are in different hemispheres, allowing users to view the entire scope of astronomical objects that can be seen from Earth. The large size of the telescopes (2-meter primary mirrors) enables students and scientists to observe very faint objects. The proximity of the two telescopes in latitude means that night time observations for students located near the two telescopes must occur in night time hours. Students in the continental United States, the UK, and other geographical locations, can often schedule their observations during their classroom or daytime hours. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nBut resources are available at any time.

The 2-meter Faulkes telescopes will remain in operation. In addition, there will be up to 16 1-meter telescopes and as many as 24 40cm telescopes. Each class of telescope supports an array of scientific explorations and projects,and will have time available for amateur and educational astrophysics use.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nBecause of the geographic spread of the telescopes, users will be able to make real-time observations in night skies at any time. The first installation of 1-meter and 40cm telescopes will take place in Cerro Tololo, Chile during 2011. LCOGT will soon be true to their slogan, We Keep You in the Dark.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EResearch Endeavors Continue\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nThe educational program wins converts wherever it touches down. In a letter dated August 6\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C\/sup\u003E, Mr. Pfluke\u2019s assistant and mother, Anastasia Pfluke, wrote to Wayne Rosing, founder and president of LCOGT, that the \u201cFaulkes time turned into one of the most special nights we\u2019ve spent on Maui (and if you\u2019ve ever been here, you know that\u2019s saying a lot).\u201d\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nMr. Pfluke is continuing his research on the Faulkes telescopes. \u201cI was researching an NEO, T38512, with Dr. J. D. Pan-STARRS discovered it very recently,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Rosing. \u201cI obviously couldn\u2019t have done the research without the Faulkes.\u201d NEO is insider terminology for Near-Earth Objects, typically comets and asteroids in orbits near the Earth. Pan-STARRS-1 is the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu\/public\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EPanoramic Survey Telescope \u0026amp; Rapid Response System\u003C\/a\u003E, a program in which LCOGT is a half-partner with Harvard-Smithsonian. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nHowever, T38512 remains unconfirmed. \u201cWe attempted to recover T38512 a couple of weeks ago,\u201d Dr. Armstrong said, \u201cbut instead saw another asteroid. To the best of my knowledge T38512 was never recovered. It would have been Pan-STARRS second NEO.\u00a0It was a long shot to try and catch it, but the payoff would have been well worth the investment. Since the asteroid that Anthony and I did see needs some follow-up observations, we are planning on doing that later this month.\u201d\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EPublication Demands\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nPublished on Maui for a select distribution for several years now, The Pfluke Times is time-consuming to create \u2013 it is nearly all hand-written \u2013 and so is issued on an irregular schedule. Subscriptions are isolated to immediate family at this writing, however the firm is considering a transition to web publication in the near future.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\nMs. Pfluke did note that the experience had a detrimental effect on play time for Mr. Pfluke. \u201cOn our second day working on that first Faulkes worksheet, the neighbor kids came to see if he could play, and he didn\u2019t even ask me if he could go; he just told them he\u2019d be out as soon as he was done. He wanted to finish his astronomy first.\u201d\n\u003C\/p\u003E",

FITS, or Flexible Image Transport System, is a file format used widely in astronomy to share images.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an astronomy student I remember finding FITS files a little mysterious. Their large file sizes made them seem antiquated compared to \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JPEG\u0022\u003EJPEG\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Portable_Network_Graphics\u0022\u003EPNG\u003C\/a\u003E image formats but they do have some advantages: they store useful astronomical information about your observation (e.g. coordinates on the sky, details about the instrument, observer etc); they have a larger \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.communicatingastronomy.org\/cap2007\/talks\/071010_01\/Hurt%20Dynamic%20Range.pdf\u0022\u003Edynamic range\u003C\/a\u003E (PDF link); and they can store more than just images\u003Ca href=\u0022#footnote\u0022\u003E*\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few years ago, whilst testing \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.esa.int\/esaMI\/Planck\/SEMBU20YUFF_0.html#subhead1\u0022\u003Esome astronomical radiometers\u003C\/a\u003E, I had to work out how to output time-series data in FITS format from a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.cprogramming.com\/\u0022\u003EC\u003C\/a\u003E program. It was a steep learning curve for someone who had never processed binary data with code. A week or so ago I was talking to \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/jyardley.co.uk\/\u0022\u003EJon Yardley\u003C\/a\u003E about how good it would be to be able to work with FITS files in a web browser. Web browser manufacturers don\u0026#39;t support FITS files but during the conversation I realised that I had the tools to do it without the need for extra browser plugins.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast year I \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.strudel.org.uk\/avm\/js\/\u0022\u003Eexperimented\u003C\/a\u003E with \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.strudel.org.uk\/blog\/astro\/000944.shtml\u0022\u003Ereading astronomy visualisation metadata (AVM) from JPEGs\u003C\/a\u003E. That made use of Jacob Seidelin\u0026#39;s \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.nihilogic.dk\/labs\/binaryajax\/binaryajax.js\u0022\u003EJavascript library for reading binary files\u003C\/a\u003E and lets you read them byte by byte. More recently \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/user\/slowe\/dev\/virtualsky\/\u0022\u003EI\u0026#39;ve learnt how to draw in the browser\u003C\/a\u003E using HTML5\u0026#39;s \u0026lt;canvas\u0026gt;. The result is that I can now \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/user\/slowe\/dev\/fits\/\u0022\u003Edisplay a FITS file in a web page\u003C\/a\u003E. The \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/github.com\/slowe\/jsFITS\u0022\u003Ecode is available\u003C\/a\u003E if you want to have a play with it.

It was a steep learning curve for someone who had never processed binary data with code.

The fruits of this, benefit research, outreach, and the grey area in between (as demonstrated by Zooniverse and Citizen Science Alliance). It brings together a mixture of traditional researchers, coding and web experts, people who blog about science, and exciting things happen.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe week did not follow the usual structure for conferences, with every afternoon being left open for informal \u0026quot;unconference\u0026quot; sessions to be arranged ad-hoc, and Tuesday afternoon (and into the late night) being reserved for a \u0026quot;hack day\u0026quot;. Every morning there were talks with 2 excellent keynote speakers and 13 other invited speakers (myself included).\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nJill Tarter, Seti Institute and David Hogg, NYU gave excellent keynote talks ranging from the search for extraterrestrial life to why a kitten was mistaken for a comet.

            "value": "\u003Cp\u003E\r\nBuilding a photometric shutter can be a complicated task. The goal is to expose every pixel of the CCD for the exact same window of time. However, since we have to live within the bounds of reality, we must cope with the fact that the shutter cannot physically open and close instantaneously.\u00a0The next best option is to expose every pixel for the exact same \u003Cem\u003Eamount\u003C\/em\u003E of time.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe shutter designed for the 1.0m Sinistro imaging package is a round nylon composite disk with cut-outs (see the Shutter disk image and the Shutter dimensions drawing) that rotates around the center axis of the disk; it looks like Pacman. When the cut-out is positioned over the CCD, photos from the sky are allowed to collect in the CCD, creating an image of the sky. Keep in mind three states of the shutter relating to an exposure:\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Col\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli\u003EShutter closed, with cut-out positioned in a negative direction (counter-clockwise) from the CCD field of view. This is the position shown in the picture.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli\u003EShutter open, cut-out is centered over the CCD field of view.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cli\u003EShutter closed, with cut-out positioned in a positive direction (clockwise) from the CCD field of view.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ol\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe two closed states are important because a single exposure uses all three states to expose each pixel of the CCD for the same amount of time. Each exposure consists of two moves: 1) from state 1 to state 2, and 2) from state 2 to state 3. Both moves are in the same direction, so the cut-out leaves the CCD field of view on the opposite side it entered. The next exposure just reverses the procedure, but follows the same rules. See the Shutter Exposure video to see two 2-second exposures; you will notice the first exposure consists of two moves, then the second exposure consists of two moves in the opposite direction.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nNow the tricky part: exposing every pixel the same amount of time. Because the transit of the edge of the cut-out across the CCD field of view takes a non-zero amount of time, by the time the cut-out is fully exposing the CCD, pixels near the edge of the CCD where the shutter cut-out started the move have had more time to collect photons from the sky!\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThink of it this way: picture a stage in a theater with a big heavy curtain across the front. Behind the curtain are three flashing lightbulbs that flash once every second. They are spaced evenly across the stage, from left to right. You\u0027re sitting in the audience, so you can\u0027t see the flashing lights yet. But as the curtain is drawn across the stage (this one goes left to right, not up and down!) you start seeing one lightbulb flashing. You see it flash four times, then as the curtain is drawn further across the stage, you see a second lightbulb. Finally, you see the third lightbulb. All three lightbulbs have been flashing at the same rate, but you saw the first bulb flash 12 times, the second flash 8 times, and the third only 4 times! So in your snapshot of the lights on stage (i.e. your exposure), you saw a different amount of light from each bulb, even though we know they were all emitting at the same rate.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nHow do we solve this problem? To continue with the example, we need a second curtain that has been hiding offstage to be pulled across the stage at the same rate as the first curtain. The rate of travel is important because you can think of the sky as an infinite array of lights and every one deserves the same amount of time so we can accurately measure its light!\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nTo reiterate the key to solving this problem, as the shutter transitions over the CCD field of view, it must be moving at a constant speed. This applies both for when it is transitioning to the open position, and when it is transitioning to the closed position. If the speed is constant (and the same between both moves), we can be confident that each pixel is being exposed for the same amount of time.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nNow, how do we get the contsant speed? If we look at the shutter dimensions drawing, it shows that the shutter has approximately 112 degrees to move from closed position to open (and vice-versa). We also see that the shutter has approximately a 14 degree window to get to up to speed before transitioning across the CCD field of view. So, now we know we need a 112 degree move and we must reach maximum velocity within the first 14 degrees of the move.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nLucky for me, our controller includes a\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pmdcorp.com\/advanced-motion-control\/advanced-motion-control.cfm\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 title=\u0022Magellan Motion Processor MC580000\u0022\u003EPMD motion processor\u003C\/a\u003E\u00a0that makes defining the motion profile pretty simple. I normally use an S-curve profile because it provides the smoothest motion, but due to the 14 degree acceleration window constraint, I\u0027m using a trapezoidal profile to simplify the math. Using some physics equations (thanks to my colleague Strawberry), we found the relationship between maximum velocity and acceleration, to meet the 14 degree target. This relationship allowed me to write a routine to tune the speed of the shutter using a single input for the maximum velocity.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe routine starts with a large velocity, attempts a move equal to the distance of a shutter open move, then checks the encoder position to see if it was actually able to complete the move. If the velocity or acceleration is too high, the motor does not have enough power to perform the move, so the maximum velocity is reduced, and the move is attempted again. This is performed until the move is successful, according to the encoder position.\u00a0The routine also writes the motion profile out as JSON data, then uses flot to plot the profile.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022425\u0022 height=\u0022349\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vPWX7JZjS2I\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nIn the Shutter motion profile image, in the top plot, the yellow line is shutter position (the left axis) and you can see it runs from 0 to 112 degrees. The bottom axis is time in milliseconds. The blue and red lines are shutter speed in degrees\/msec, the blue is commanded, or planned by the motion profile generator, and the red is actual computed from values read off the encoder. The bottom image shows commanded and actual shutter speeds vs shutter position. The thin green line in the bottom plot is the 14.4 degree target where the shutter must be at constant velocity.

            "safe_value": " \u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding a photometric shutter can be a complicated task. The goal is to expose every pixel of the CCD for the exact same window of time. However, since we have to live within the bounds of reality, we must cope with the fact that the shutter cannot physically open and close instantaneously.\u00a0The next best option is to expose every pixel for the exact same \u003Cem\u003Eamount\u003C\/em\u003E of time.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shutter designed for the 1.0m Sinistro imaging package is a round nylon composite disk with cut-outs (see the Shutter disk image and the Shutter dimensions drawing) that rotates around the center axis of the disk; it looks like Pacman. When the cut-out is positioned over the CCD, photos from the sky are allowed to collect in the CCD, creating an image of the sky. Keep in mind three states of the shutter relating to an exposure:\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShutter closed, with cut-out positioned in a negative direction (counter-clockwise) from the CCD field of view. This is the position shown in the picture.\u003C\/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EShutter open, cut-out is centered over the CCD field of view.\u003C\/li\u003E\n\t\u003Cli\u003EShutter closed, with cut-out positioned in a positive direction (clockwise) from the CCD field of view.\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two closed states are important because a single exposure uses all three states to expose each pixel of the CCD for the same amount of time. Each exposure consists of two moves: 1) from state 1 to state 2, and 2) from state 2 to state 3. Both moves are in the same direction, so the cut-out leaves the CCD field of view on the opposite side it entered. The next exposure just reverses the procedure, but follows the same rules. See the Shutter Exposure video to see two 2-second exposures; you will notice the first exposure consists of two moves, then the second exposure consists of two moves in the opposite direction.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the tricky part: exposing every pixel the same amount of time. Because the transit of the edge of the cut-out across the CCD field of view takes a non-zero amount of time, by the time the cut-out is fully exposing the CCD, pixels near the edge of the CCD where the shutter cut-out started the move have had more time to collect photons from the sky!\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of it this way: picture a stage in a theater with a big heavy curtain across the front. Behind the curtain are three flashing lightbulbs that flash once every second. They are spaced evenly across the stage, from left to right. You\u0027re sitting in the audience, so you can\u0027t see the flashing lights yet. But as the curtain is drawn across the stage (this one goes left to right, not up and down!) you start seeing one lightbulb flashing. You see it flash four times, then as the curtain is drawn further across the stage, you see a second lightbulb. Finally, you see the third lightbulb. All three lightbulbs have been flashing at the same rate, but you saw the first bulb flash 12 times, the second flash 8 times, and the third only 4 times! So in your snapshot of the lights on stage (i.e. your exposure), you saw a different amount of light from each bulb, even though we know they were all emitting at the same rate.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do we solve this problem? To continue with the example, we need a second curtain that has been hiding offstage to be pulled across the stage at the same rate as the first curtain. The rate of travel is important because you can think of the sky as an infinite array of lights and every one deserves the same amount of time so we can accurately measure its light!\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate the key to solving this problem, as the shutter transitions over the CCD field of view, it must be moving at a constant speed. This applies both for when it is transitioning to the open position, and when it is transitioning to the closed position. If the speed is constant (and the same between both moves), we can be confident that each pixel is being exposed for the same amount of time.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, how do we get the contsant speed? If we look at the shutter dimensions drawing, it shows that the shutter has approximately 112 degrees to move from closed position to open (and vice-versa). We also see that the shutter has approximately a 14 degree window to get to up to speed before transitioning across the CCD field of view. So, now we know we need a 112 degree move and we must reach maximum velocity within the first 14 degrees of the move.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucky for me, our controller includes a\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.pmdcorp.com\/advanced-motion-control\/advanced-motion-control.cfm\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 title=\u0022Magellan Motion Processor MC580000\u0022\u003EPMD motion processor\u003C\/a\u003E\u00a0that makes defining the motion profile pretty simple. I normally use an S-curve profile because it provides the smoothest motion, but due to the 14 degree acceleration window constraint, I\u0027m using a trapezoidal profile to simplify the math. Using some physics equations (thanks to my colleague Strawberry), we found the relationship between maximum velocity and acceleration, to meet the 14 degree target. This relationship allowed me to write a routine to tune the speed of the shutter using a single input for the maximum velocity.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe routine starts with a large velocity, attempts a move equal to the distance of a shutter open move, then checks the encoder position to see if it was actually able to complete the move. If the velocity or acceleration is too high, the motor does not have enough power to perform the move, so the maximum velocity is reduced, and the move is attempted again. This is performed until the move is successful, according to the encoder position.\u00a0The routine also writes the motion profile out as JSON data, then uses flot to plot the profile.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022425\u0022 height=\u0022349\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vPWX7JZjS2I\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the Shutter motion profile image, in the top plot, the yellow line is shutter position (the left axis) and you can see it runs from 0 to 112 degrees. The bottom axis is time in milliseconds. The blue and red lines are shutter speed in degrees\/msec, the blue is commanded, or planned by the motion profile generator, and the red is actual computed from values read off the encoder. The bottom image shows commanded and actual shutter speeds vs shutter position. The thin green line in the bottom plot is the 14.4 degree target where the shutter must be at constant velocity. The green shading in both plots shows the regions where the shutter is either acceleration or decelerating, as opposed to the white section in the middle, where it is at constant (maximum) speed.

You can measure as many of these images as you like because Agent Exoplanet will combine your measurements with those of other volunteers, and produce a combined result. Ideally you would measure the whole set for one exoplanet, but you can choose just to measure part of the set and either come back later and pick up where you left off or leave your data for another volunteer to complete.\r\n\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nAt any point you can see if you have measured enough data to start the final analysis by clicking on each of the lightcurve tabs, to the right of the page.

Nearly 700 exoplanets are currently known about, with astronomers discovering more every day. \n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Agent Exoplanet we want anyone interested in exoplanets to be able to do their own analysis of astronomical data using the same method as professional scientists, without the need for downloading data files or installing software; all the tools you need for Agent Exoplanet are available to you in your web-browser.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgent Exoplanet takes you through analysing a set of images for an exoplanet as it passes in front of it\u0027s sun, and carefully measuring the brightness of this star to observe a small dip. You can measure as many of these images as you like because Agent Exoplanet will combine your measurements with those of other volunteers, and produce a combined result. Ideally you would measure the whole set for one exoplanet, but you can choose just to measure part of the set and either come back later and pick up where you left off or leave your data for another volunteer to complete.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any point you can see if you have measured enough data to start the final analysis by clicking on each of the lightcurve tabs, to the right of the page. If you have not, just carry on measuring the dataset.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally Agent Exoplanet will show you the final lightcurve and produces a scaled cartoon of this extra-solar planetary system based on your and all other volunteer\u0027s combined measurements.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Agent Exoplanet anyone can have the thrill of investigating the properties of exoplanets in the same way as professional scientists.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe astronomical data is taken on LCOGT telescopes specifically for Agent Exoplanet, citizen scientists being the first to analyze it. We will be adding more data sets to Agent Exoplanet continually, so there are plenty of exoplanets to choose from.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are interested have a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/portal.lcogt.net\/agentexoplanet\/briefing\/\u0022\u003EMission Briefing\u003C\/a\u003E or watch our tutorial video, and become an LCOGT citizen scientist at: \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/portal.lcogt.net\/agentexoplanet\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/portal.lcogt.net\/agentexoplanet\u003C\/a\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qY1N-v4TwOg?rel=0\u0026amp;hd=1\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n ",

Some optical engineers do become eye doctors, and specialize in \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Optics\u0022\u003Eoptics\u003C\/a\u003E that help people see better, but there are lots of other types of optical engineers too. Anything that involves the usage of light probably involved an optical engineer at some point. The camera in your cell phone, a DVD player, a telescope, and a copy machine are just a few examples of things an optical engineer could work on. \u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: What does your work at LCOGT involve?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: I am responsible for pretty much all of the optical design work that goes on here. That means I have to figure out what shape the mirrors and\/or lenses have to be in whatever instrument I\u0026#39;m working on. My latest project was designing a \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/secure.lcogt.net\/blog\/rross\/floyds-first-light\u0022\u003Espectrograph\u003C\/a\u003E, which had three mirrors, one lens, a prism and a diffraction grating. In addition to doing the optical design, I also have to tolerance the system. The process of tolerancing is basically figuring out how \u0026quot;not perfect\u0026quot; any of the optics can be and have the entire instrument still perform within spec. Because the wavelength of light is so small, even the smallest deformations on an optical surface can be a really big deal. For example, the primary mirror for our 1.0 meter telescope is only allowed to have errors of about 32 nanometers. That\u0026#39;s 100x\u0026#39;s smaller than the width of a human hair! \u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: I have a Bachelors in Physics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and a Masters in Optical Sciences from the University of Arizona. \u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: What led you to the career\/job you are doing now?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: A lot of hard work and a little bit of chance. I studied physics in college because I loved it, but I didn\u0026#39;t know exactly what career path I wanted to follow. I had a slight preference for optics, so I got an internship here at LCOGT that allowed me to get my feet wet in the world of optics. I quickly fell in love with it, and that\u0026#39;s when I went back to school to get my Masters in Optical Sciences, all while still working at LCOGT.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: I usually spend most of my time using a computer program called \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.zemax.com\/index.php?option=com_frontpage\u0026amp;Itemid=1\u0022\u003EZemax\u003C\/a\u003E, an optical design program that lets me draw and analyze the performance of optical systems.

Some optical engineers do become eye doctors, and specialize in \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Optics\u0022\u003Eoptics\u003C\/a\u003E that help people see better, but there are lots of other types of optical engineers too. Anything that involves the usage of light probably involved an optical engineer at some point. The camera in your cell phone, a DVD player, a telescope, and a copy machine are just a few examples of things an optical engineer could work on. \u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: What does your work at LCOGT involve?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: I am responsible for pretty much all of the optical design work that goes on here. That means I have to figure out what shape the mirrors and\/or lenses have to be in whatever instrument I\u0027m working on. My latest project was designing a \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/secure.lcogt.net\/blog\/rross\/floyds-first-light\u0022\u003Espectrograph\u003C\/a\u003E, which had three mirrors, one lens, a prism and a diffraction grating. In addition to doing the optical design, I also have to tolerance the system. The process of tolerancing is basically figuring out how \u0022not perfect\u0022 any of the optics can be and have the entire instrument still perform within spec. Because the wavelength of light is so small, even the smallest deformations on an optical surface can be a really big deal. For example, the primary mirror for our 1.0 meter telescope is only allowed to have errors of about 32 nanometers. That\u0027s 100x\u0027s smaller than the width of a human hair! \u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: I have a Bachelors in Physics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and a Masters in Optical Sciences from the University of Arizona. \u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#073763;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EJB: What led you to the career\/job you are doing now?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ERH: A lot of hard work and a little bit of chance. I studied physics in college because I loved it, but I didn\u0027t know exactly what career path I wanted to follow. I had a slight preference for optics, so I got an internship here at LCOGT that allowed me to get my feet wet in the world of optics.

extrasolar planets as well as studies of pulsating and magnetically active stars.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFederica presented a poster presenting the BOS and FTN lightcurves of SN2011fe, the

This distinction is necessary because the observation types differ with respect to the mechanism by which observations are scheduled, and the expected cost in telescope resource per hour of on-sky time.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIf you desire fixed-block time, \u003Cstrong\u003Edo not\u003C\/strong\u003E pad your request to allow for possible bad weather; \u00a0ask for what your science requires. \u00a0The TAC will take weather into account (up to a factor of 2 padding) without your asking. \u00a0If, however, such padding does not make sense (perhaps you wish to observe a once-in-a-century event, for which repeat observing is not possible), then please put a statement to this effect in the body of your proposal.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIf the TAC awards you fixed-block observing time for your science you will be allocated an LCOGT liaison astronomer. Please coordinate the scheduling and the particulars of your observing requirements directly with them. \u00a0Give as much advance warning as possible so we can resolve any conflicting programs, but at least 3-5 weeks (the schedule is usually done in 2-week blocks, with requests due 3 weeks before the start of the block).\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003ETIME CHARGING POLICY\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules for how time is deducted from a user\u0027s observing program based on the observation type are as follows:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EFixed-block Observations\u003C\/h3\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFor every fixed-block observation scheduled to be observed, an equal amount of time is deducted from the total available to that program in the semester, regardless of the quality of the data collected or whether any data were collected at all.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPrograms may release a requested block (by contacting your LCOGT liaison) up to 7 days prior to the date of the scheduled observation. If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EQueue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)\u003C\/h3\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThese observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EQueue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are\u003Cbr \/\u003Eattempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality.

As a kid I would take apart anything that I didn\u0026#39;t understand, just to see what was inside. I broke our first family computer trying to edit a compiled system file...I wondered what would happen. As soon as a programming class was available in high school, I took it.

I gave tours of the LCOGT facilities to two groups of school kids and their teachers explaining what the facilities are for and how schools in South Africa benefit from the different program LCOGT is running at the moment.\u00a0 Overall, there was a big excitement among all the people who heard the news that robotic telescopes that can be used for educational purpose are coming to South Africa and Africa. Many are looking forward to using them to drive education and public understanding of astronomy in their community.\u00a0 Most importantly, my visit created an opportunity to plan more organized future activities not only in Sutherland but also in the neighboring towns in the near future. \u003C\/font\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E ",

There is no science without communication because science only becomes useful once communicated. That doesn\u0026#39;t mean that everyone has to understand everything. The point is to get people wondering about science and using their brains. As scientists communicating with the public, we deliver the tool-kit, not the product.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe way we communicate has changed substantially with the Web, allowing communities to form regardless of geographical location. We are being given an unprecedented opportunity to embrace diversity, and I really like the idea of taking advantage of this so people can learn from a young age in a global context. In fact, I am set to embark on bringing together school groups from different countries to jointly work on astronomy projects. I had my own exposure to diversity from a young age, growing up in Germany and having been exposed to many different places, with many trips to Italy in particular. I am now actively contributing to the development of astronomical research in Iran and Qatar, as well as embedding these countries in an international outreach network.

I was also recently selected to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.globalyoungacademy.org\/\u0022\u003EGlobal Young Academy\u003C\/a\u003E and I am pushing hard there for projects about education, science for development, communicating science to the public, as well as providing the best possible environment for young researchers to unleash their creativity.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences. \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMD: I have many interests ranging from history to mathematics, from geography to computer science, from chemistry to languages, and so on. I studied physics at Dortmund in Germany where I did my undergraduate and graduate studies. I studied physics for the generic skills and opportunities I felt it provided, and fell into astronomy by chance later on by following my curiosity.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI like to reinvent myself every three years or so. I don\u0026#39;t like the idea of being an established scientist, I am constantly changing, questioning and doing new things. Maybe in three years time, I will be doing something that I cannot even imagine right now!\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis is why I have given up on making detailed long-term plans. We have no idea where we will be in the future. You have to follow your ambitions. Everything you are doing is part of yourself and doesn\u0026#39;t fall into categories. Similarly, disciplinary boundaries in science don\u0026#39;t make sense. Problems don\u0026#39;t follow disciplinary boundaries.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EJB: What led you to the career\/job you are doing now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMD: While studying physics, I tended towards theoretical particle physics, but then an opportunity arose for me in gravitational lensing (and later more specifically microlensing), which caught my interest because it was a rather new area which meant not that much work had been done, so I had a great playing field. After having completed my PhD, I got a fellowship from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.dfg.de\/en\/index.jsp\u0022\u003EGerman Research Foundation\u003C\/a\u003E to work at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.stsci.edu\/\u0022\u003ESpace Telescope Science Institute\u003C\/a\u003E in Baltimore, and then moved to \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.rug.nl\/\u0022\u003EGroningen\u003C\/a\u003E in the Netherlands when I received a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/research\/mariecurieactions\/\u0022\u003EMarie Curie fellowship\u003C\/a\u003E. In 2000, I was struck by poor health and was unable to work for three years. After that I received an offer from \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.st-andrews.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003ESt Andrews\u003C\/a\u003E and went to Scotland. In 2006, I received a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/royalsociety.org\/grants\/schemes\/university-research\/\u0022\u003ERoyal Society University Research Fellowship\u003C\/a\u003E and am still in St Andrews.

Being a born German, I have a plan for the day (and for the week, and for several months ahead), but not infrequently during the day something else emerges and by the end of the day, I\u0026#39;ve ended up doing something different from my plan. My days are spent doing things like analyzing data, writing publications, thinking, developing new concepts, presenting, too much traveling, arguing the case for science, and engaging in educational and outreach activities, which includes talking to everyone about scientific endeavour.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMD: Think carefully about what it is you want to do. You can do a great job going for something you believe in. If you don\u0026#39;t believe in what you are doing, do something different. Doing what you believe in still requires hard work and you need skills and the drive. You also need to know the difference between success and excellence. Success is meeting expectations. Excellence goes further. It\u0026#39;s amazing what a single person can achieve if they go for it. Dreams don\u0026#39;t need to stay dreams - they can turn into reality.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EJB: How does astronomy apply to day-to-day life? \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMD: We apparently have a fascination for other worlds, but this appears to be rooted in the deep interest in ourselves. Astronomy provides us with context and thereby helps us to understand humanity and its role in the nearer or farther environment. The unique remains enigmatic forever. Understanding the wider picture requires something to compare, and we actually learn from diversity. If there happens to be life on other planets, it will teach us about life on Earth. Rather frequently, the question pops up what we get from science, and in particular politicians keep asking it. But isn\u0026#39;t it clear that being knowledgeable is advantageous to being ignorant?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EJB: Do you personally think there is life on other planets?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMD: I have two answers for you to that question. The scientific answer is: we don\u0026#39;t know. We simply lack evidence to say. The other answer is a philosophical one and comes from my personal discomfort with exactly (!) one instance of life in the huge universe. There are at least a hundred billion stars in our galaxy and at least a hundred billion galaxies in the universe. We are now finding that many of these stars have planets, and there could well be more planets than stars. If we are unique, we are the result of a fluke. The thought that we should not be here makes me shudder (although this might be true).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBy finding other instances of life in the universe, we might get a glimpse of our future, and should there be life beyond Earth, I have rather little doubt that we will find it some day - maybe even sooner rather than later. Advances in technology can cause crucial changes, and cannot be predicted, not even by Albert Einstein. When Einstein first thought about the gravitational microlensing effect, he did not believe in it becoming observable. But he could not anticipate the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transistor\u0022\u003Etransistor\u003C\/a\u003E in particular, which not only revolutionized computing, but also paved the way towards our digital cameras. As a result, a phenomenon with \u0026ldquo;no great chance\u0026rdquo; to be observed eventually turned into a tool that is at the scientific forefront for finding very small planets. Technically, we could discover a planet with a mass as low as that of our Moon! It is the lucky-imaging cameras on the LCOGT network that could make the crucial difference.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EA lot of the research related to extraterrestrial life focuses on habitability and what is usually called the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Habitable_zone\u0022\u003Ehabitable zone\u003C\/a\u003E, but this is a reflection of Earth-centric prejudice and speculation. We don\u0026#39;t know the probability or the conditions required for life. There are at least three ways to look for extraterrestrial life: go to other bodies in the Solar System, look for atmospheric signatures from \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/royalsociety.org\/news\/metro\/exoplanets\/\u0022\u003Eexoplanets\u003C\/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/setilive.org\/\u0022\u003Elook for signals from other intelligent civilizations\u003C\/a\u003E. The question about life beyond Earth is probably as old as humankind itself. Imagination is important and speculation has its role, but if we want to find life, we have to explore.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EJB: Thanks Martin!\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

It is the lucky-imaging cameras on the LCOGT network that could make the crucial difference.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EA lot of the research related to extraterrestrial life focuses on habitability and what is usually called the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Habitable_zone\u0022\u003Ehabitable zone\u003C\/a\u003E, but this is a reflection of Earth-centric prejudice and speculation. We don\u0027t know the probability or the conditions required for life. There are at least three ways to look for extraterrestrial life: go to other bodies in the Solar System, look for atmospheric signatures from \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/royalsociety.org\/news\/metro\/exoplanets\/\u0022\u003Eexoplanets\u003C\/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/setilive.org\/\u0022\u003Elook for signals from other intelligent civilizations\u003C\/a\u003E.

The Weather project is comprised of many lines of back-end code to store the values in a customized database, process the data values for the graphing of raw and derived values, and the graphing code which is written using the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.python.org\/\u0022\u003EPython\u003C\/a\u003E library \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/matplotlib.sourceforge.net\/\u0022\u003EMatplotlib\u003C\/a\u003E.

This method increases the simplicity and speed of the site, keeping the graphing decoupled from the front-end user interface.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe front-end code contains the logic that is able to display the most recent values and explain the meaning of the data to the user. One of the key pieces of information displayed by the site is the enclosure open\/closed status. Not only can the users see whether or not the current conditions will allow the dome to open but they can also see historical statistics on when and why the telescope has been closed in the past. This data is further supported with constantly updating live images of the sky at each enclosure site.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design of the new site was a collaborative effort. Early on in the year, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/user\/slowe\u0022\u003EStuart Lowe\u003C\/a\u003E came to me with a design prototype for the new web page. We worked together to develop the prototype into what would eventually become the interface for this version. The goal was to better integrate the Weather application into the main LCOGT website. This included a complete redesign of the original interface to fit the smaller template and keep with the design themes of the main site. It was important to both Stuart and I that the new design feature, first and foremost, the information on the current status of the enclosures as affected by the current weather conditions at site. Thus, throughout the new design, the values are much more prominent and accessible. As part of the list of new features, the website is now configured to better handle multi-platform mobile devices to ensure the greater potential for access to the website. Thus the display of the information is not constrained by device. The website is built to handle display for those who do not use Javascript, but has some nice functionality for graph selection for the Javascript-enabled browsers. Overall the website is much more robust in the features it offers and more solidly supported.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe website provides data on the enclosures located at \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/weather\/ogg\/\u0022\u003EHaleakala\u003C\/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/weather\/coj\/\u0022\u003ESiding Spring\u003C\/a\u003E, the Santa Barbara \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/weather\/bpl\/\u0022\u003EBack Parking Lot\u003C\/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/weather\/sqa\/\u0022\u003ESedgwick Reserve\u003C\/a\u003E.

Because of my HR work, I am in the unique position of knowing everyone here and their basic job. This allows me to see ways we can strategically connect people to work together. It\u0026rsquo;s an amazing part of my job, learning what everybody does. I have a real admiration for what people here are doing and are capable of. I love the part of my job that involves working with people, but I also need quiet time and the accounting side helps balance that by giving me some quiet concentration time.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: I grew up on a farm and was always kind of a tomboy, gaining a real connection with nature. My family moved to Santa Barbara in the early 1960\u0026rsquo;s. I went to UCSB and started off as a French major, thinking that I would become an interpreter and live in France. I changed from that direction when I decided to get married in my second year of college, taking time off of school and working before returning to finish UCSB as an Environmental Studies major, then a new program and more aligned with my passion for the environmental movement. My work with numbers and accounting began during this period because I supplemented my income with part-time bookkeeping jobs, later using the flexibility to enable me to prioritize raising my two sons. I eventually built this into a business that specialized in small business consulting, helping build financial systems that paralleled the story of a business. This, of course, brought me to Wayne and Dorothy as clients and then to the transition of my business to my son, leaving me free to join LCOGT in its infancy - a new child to raise! Being a mother to my sons has been and continues to be the most important job of my life with my husband, Duffy and LCOGT coming in close behind.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI love sports. If I had started earlier, I think I would have wanted to be a professional soccer player! I think that, especially for women, learning to compete in a healthy way carries over into every aspect of life, especially the workplace.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: My days are all pretty varied and I like it that way. In the morning I usually check email right away in case there are any HR or accounting urgent matters. Each day there are accounting tasks, HR issues, organizational stuff, and I also always have my eye on upcoming tax compliance due dates.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: Very few people would say they want to go into admin. It seems to have kind of a bad reputation. You need to be flexible and be able to look at things from a wider perspective than your own. I spend a lot of time working with people to find solutions that are not necessarily their first choice of how to do things, but that help everyone work together and move our organization forward.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: How does your role impact LCOGT\u0026rsquo;s mission?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: Well, many seem to consider admin a necessary evil, and it\u0026rsquo;s true that unnecessary bureaucracy can usurp its true purpose. In my work here I have really learned to appreciate this purpose staying mindful of trying to help LCOGT grow from the ground up, creating quality infrastructure and procedures. Through this, I\u0026rsquo;ve become more aware of the value of the service that the admin function plays. Wayne made it clear early on that he wanted there to be purpose and rationale behind every procedure. The point is not to create bureaucracy, but to help us all be productive and successful. Walking that line has been a huge challenge. Creating a consciousness of our spending is similar - we all want to do high quality work with high quality products and tools - at the same time, we have to be mindful that we have fixed funding so need to spend wisely. I want to be sure we reach our ultimate mission with the money we have to spend.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: Thanks Maida!\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

Because of my HR work, I am in the unique position of knowing everyone here and their basic job. This allows me to see ways we can strategically connect people to work together. It\u2019s an amazing part of my job, learning what everybody does. I have a real admiration for what people here are doing and are capable of. I love the part of my job that involves working with people, but I also need quiet time and the accounting side helps balance that by giving me some quiet concentration time.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: I grew up on a farm and was always kind of a tomboy, gaining a real connection with nature. My family moved to Santa Barbara in the early 1960\u2019s. I went to UCSB and started off as a French major, thinking that I would become an interpreter and live in France. I changed from that direction when I decided to get married in my second year of college, taking time off of school and working before returning to finish UCSB as an Environmental Studies major, then a new program and more aligned with my passion for the environmental movement. My work with numbers and accounting began during this period because I supplemented my income with part-time bookkeeping jobs, later using the flexibility to enable me to prioritize raising my two sons. I eventually built this into a business that specialized in small business consulting, helping build financial systems that paralleled the story of a business. This, of course, brought me to Wayne and Dorothy as clients and then to the transition of my business to my son, leaving me free to join LCOGT in its infancy - a new child to raise! Being a mother to my sons has been and continues to be the most important job of my life with my husband, Duffy and LCOGT coming in close behind.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI love sports. If I had started earlier, I think I would have wanted to be a professional soccer player! I think that, especially for women, learning to compete in a healthy way carries over into every aspect of life, especially the workplace.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: My days are all pretty varied and I like it that way. In the morning I usually check email right away in case there are any HR or accounting urgent matters. Each day there are accounting tasks, HR issues, organizational stuff, and I also always have my eye on upcoming tax compliance due dates.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: Very few people would say they want to go into admin. It seems to have kind of a bad reputation. You need to be flexible and be able to look at things from a wider perspective than your own. I spend a lot of time working with people to find solutions that are not necessarily their first choice of how to do things, but that help everyone work together and move our organization forward.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: How does your role impact LCOGT\u2019s mission?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EMS: Well, many seem to consider admin a necessary evil, and it\u2019s true that unnecessary bureaucracy can usurp its true purpose. In my work here I have really learned to appreciate this purpose staying mindful of trying to help LCOGT grow from the ground up, creating quality infrastructure and procedures. Through this, I\u2019ve become more aware of the value of the service that the admin function plays. Wayne made it clear early on that he wanted there to be purpose and rationale behind every procedure. The point is not to create bureaucracy, but to help us all be productive and successful. Walking that line has been a huge challenge. Creating a consciousness of our spending is similar - we all want to do high quality work with high quality products and tools - at the same time, we have to be mindful that we have fixed funding so need to spend wisely. I want to be sure we reach our ultimate mission with the money we have to spend.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic;\u0022\u003EJB: Thanks Maida!\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E ",

I\u0026rsquo;m also contributing to the coding for the public observing interface that will be used once our network comes online. I actually think of these things as hand-made, kind of like a craft. I know a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t think of things on the web this way, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s the same kind of crafting process where you make something, then whittle it down, work on it some more, and polish it until you\u0026rsquo;re happy with it.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences. \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: I grew up in a city and never had a telescope. As a child I was interested in space and watched Star Trek, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/doctorwho\/dw\u0022\u003EDoctor Who\u003C\/a\u003E and things like that. In secondary school I thought I wanted to be an architect, but then I realized I was spending a lot of time in school chatting with a friend about the Universe. I hadn\u0026#39;t realized until then that it was something you could study at university. I applied, and was accepted, to a degree program in physics with astrophysics at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.manchester.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003EUniversity of Manchester\u003C\/a\u003E. After that I did my PhD in radio astronomy at \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003EJodrell Bank Observatory\u003C\/a\u003E.

After my PhD I did a post-doc working on ESA\u0026rsquo;s \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.esa.int\/planck\u0022\u003EPlanck satellite\u003C\/a\u003E where I helped build and test instruments both before launch, and afterwards while it was on its way to \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L2_point\u0022\u003EL2\u003C\/a\u003E. It is great to be able to say that things I\u0026rsquo;ve handled are now 1 million miles away from the Earth.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What led you to the career\/job you are doing now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: It was a series of fortunate events. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t one of those people who knew from an young age that I wanted to be an astronomer - I just keep following my interests.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like? \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: I cycle into work at \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.cf.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003ECardiff University\u003C\/a\u003E and then spend some time catching up on emails from the previous night. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the things about working with an organization with lots of people in other time zones. I spend my day writing computer code, editing the LCOGT website, coming up with new ideas, learning new skills, and looking for inspiration of cutting edge web technology and thinking about how to adapt it to astronomy. One of the reasons I wrote \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/virtualsky\/\u0022\u003EVirtual Sky\u003C\/a\u003E was because I wanted to learn \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HTML5\u0022\u003EHTML5\u003C\/a\u003E. There are also a couple of tea breaks each day (I\u0026rsquo;m British after all) and some time spent chatting with my office mates, which is where some great ideas come from actually.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: Do things you are interested in. Don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily believe that how others think you should proceed is going to be the right way for you, and don\u0026rsquo;t stay in a job if you aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Also, things are often more flexible than they appear. For example, I recently spoke with a secondary school student who wanted to study astronomy, but was worried they might not get accepted to university because they weren\u0026rsquo;t taking physics as part of their A-levels (UK exams at age 16-18). I encouraged them to speak with someone at the university and apply anyway, because there can be more flexibility than it might appear especially if you have good mathematical skills. Persevering at mathematics is important as it gives you a great foundation for many physics-related jobs.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: Do you have any hobbies?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: Well, I used to do a lot of mountaineering, but where I live now is quite far from the mountains. However, I\u0026rsquo;m much closer to the sea now so I recently started learning to sail. A lot of my spare time I spend doing web stuff, for example I built Chromoscope in my spare time while I was working with Planck.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: Thanks Stuart!\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee previous interviews:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-maida-smith\u0022\u003EMaida Smith: \u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-maida-smith\u0022\u003EFinance and administrative director\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-abiy-tekola\u0022\u003EAbiy Tekola: \u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-abiy-tekola\u0022\u003EResearch astronomer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-mike-falarski\u0022\u003EMike Falarski: Vice-president in charge of operations\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-martin-dominik\u0022\u003EMartin Dominik: Astronomer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-ben-burleson\u0022\u003EBen Burleson: Computer Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-avi-shporer\u0022\u003EAvi Shporer: Post-doctoral fellow\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-john-hygelund\u0022\u003EJohn Hygelund: Mechanical Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-yiannis-tsapras\u0022\u003EYiannis Tsapras: Research Astronomer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-matt-dubberley\u0022\u003EMatt Dubberley: Mechanical Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-rachel-haynes\u0022\u003ERachel Haynes: Optical Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-federica-bianco\u0022\u003EFederica Bianco: Post-doctoral fellow\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-edward-gomez\u0022\u003EEdward Gomez: Education Director\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E",

I\u2019m also contributing to the coding for the public observing interface that will be used once our network comes online. I actually think of these things as hand-made, kind of like a craft. I know a lot of people don\u2019t think of things on the web this way, but I think it\u2019s the same kind of crafting process where you make something, then whittle it down, work on it some more, and polish it until you\u2019re happy with it.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself - your education, interests, past work experiences. \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: I grew up in a city and never had a telescope. As a child I was interested in space and watched Star Trek, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/doctorwho\/dw\u0022\u003EDoctor Who\u003C\/a\u003E and things like that. In secondary school I thought I wanted to be an architect, but then I realized I was spending a lot of time in school chatting with a friend about the Universe. I hadn\u0027t realized until then that it was something you could study at university. I applied, and was accepted, to a degree program in physics with astrophysics at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.manchester.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003EUniversity of Manchester\u003C\/a\u003E. After that I did my PhD in radio astronomy at \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003EJodrell Bank Observatory\u003C\/a\u003E. My PhD work was mostly using \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.uni.torun.pl\/?lang=en\u0022\u003Ea radio telescope in Poland\u003C\/a\u003E. After my PhD I did a post-doc working on ESA\u2019s \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.esa.int\/planck\u0022\u003EPlanck satellite\u003C\/a\u003E where I helped build and test instruments both before launch, and afterwards while it was on its way to \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/L2_point\u0022\u003EL2\u003C\/a\u003E. It is great to be able to say that things I\u2019ve handled are now 1 million miles away from the Earth.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What led you to the career\/job you are doing now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: It was a series of fortunate events. I wasn\u2019t one of those people who knew from an young age that I wanted to be an astronomer - I just keep following my interests.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like? \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: I cycle into work at \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.cf.ac.uk\/\u0022\u003ECardiff University\u003C\/a\u003E and then spend some time catching up on emails from the previous night. That\u2019s one of the things about working with an organization with lots of people in other time zones. I spend my day writing computer code, editing the LCOGT website, coming up with new ideas, learning new skills, and looking for inspiration of cutting edge web technology and thinking about how to adapt it to astronomy. One of the reasons I wrote \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/virtualsky\/\u0022\u003EVirtual Sky\u003C\/a\u003E was because I wanted to learn \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HTML5\u0022\u003EHTML5\u003C\/a\u003E. There are also a couple of tea breaks each day (I\u2019m British after all) and some time spent chatting with my office mates, which is where some great ideas come from actually.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do? \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: Do things you are interested in. Don\u2019t necessarily believe that how others think you should proceed is going to be the right way for you, and don\u2019t stay in a job if you aren\u2019t interested in what you\u2019re doing. Also, things are often more flexible than they appear. For example, I recently spoke with a secondary school student who wanted to study astronomy, but was worried they might not get accepted to university because they weren\u2019t taking physics as part of their A-levels (UK exams at age 16-18). I encouraged them to speak with someone at the university and apply anyway, because there can be more flexibility than it might appear especially if you have good mathematical skills. Persevering at mathematics is important as it gives you a great foundation for many physics-related jobs.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: Do you have any hobbies?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESL: Well, I used to do a lot of mountaineering, but where I live now is quite far from the mountains. However, I\u2019m much closer to the sea now so I recently started learning to sail. A lot of my spare time I spend doing web stuff, for example I built Chromoscope in my spare time while I was working with Planck.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: Thanks Stuart!\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee previous interviews:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-maida-smith\u0022\u003EMaida Smith: \u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-maida-smith\u0022\u003EFinance and administrative director\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-abiy-tekola\u0022\u003EAbiy Tekola: \u003C\/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-abiy-tekola\u0022\u003EResearch astronomer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-mike-falarski\u0022\u003EMike Falarski: Vice-president in charge of operations\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-martin-dominik\u0022\u003EMartin Dominik: Astronomer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-ben-burleson\u0022\u003EBen Burleson: Computer Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-avi-shporer\u0022\u003EAvi Shporer: Post-doctoral fellow\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-john-hygelund\u0022\u003EJohn Hygelund: Mechanical Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-yiannis-tsapras\u0022\u003EYiannis Tsapras: Research Astronomer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-matt-dubberley\u0022\u003EMatt Dubberley: Mechanical Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-rachel-haynes\u0022\u003ERachel Haynes: Optical Engineer\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-federica-bianco\u0022\u003EFederica Bianco: Post-doctoral fellow\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/blog\/jbarton\/interview-edward-gomez\u0022\u003EEdward Gomez: Education Director\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E",

There were four held at \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/site\/sedgwick\u0022\u003ESedgwick\u003C\/a\u003E and one at Photon Ranch (up in the hills above Santa Barbara). Thank you to everyone who helped plan and attended these events.

The group was about 15 people and included several young children. Everyone was very excited to be able to look through the telescopes (as well as the yummy star cookies and hot cocoa), but unfortunately the weather was not cooperating. In the occasional holes in the sky, a bright star or Mars was centered in the telescopes (a 20\u0026rdquo; reflector and an 8\u0026rdquo; Maksutov) and constellations were pointed out. Several of the young attendees participated in a Q\u0026amp;A session as well as telling stories about the sky in between the gaps in the clouds. As it usually works when trying to work around weather, as soon as the group left the skies cleared. Even though the group wasn\u0026#39;t able to see much of the sky, they still seemed to be pretty enthusiastic about learning more about astronomy and seeing some of it with their own eyes.

There were about 10 attendees of the quite varied group which enjoyed a catered appetizer dinner at Sedgwick\u0026#39;s Tipton house before heading up to the observatory for desserts, coffee, and sky gazing. The weather was cold, the skies were clear, and the group was able to observe many objects through the telescopes (including \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/network\/partner-telescopes\/sedgwick-reserve-observatory\u0022\u003EBOS\u003C\/a\u003E and an \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro-physics.com\/\u0022\u003EAP\u003C\/a\u003E 178 refractor) including Mars, Saturn, and a few globular clusters and galaxies as well as learn a few constellations and stars across the sky. The entire group was very excited and seemed to thoroughly enjoy learning about the night sky and looking through the telescopes.

This event had already been rescheduled once due to bad weather, and unfortunately the weather did not want to cooperate again. But in the breaks between the heavy clouds and before a few water droplets fell from the sky, the group of about 30 were treated to Mars, Saturn, and the waxing crescent Moon through BOS, the AP 178, and an 11\u0026rdquo; \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.celestron.com\u0022\u003ECelestron\u003C\/a\u003E. Despite the weather, the group was great in asking a lot of very good questions and very much enjoying the few objects that they were able to see (especially the rings of Saturn). LCOGT attendees included BJ Fulton, Kurt Vander Horst, and Rachel Ross.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESedgwick \u0026ndash; 5\/30:\u0026nbsp; A physics class from UCSB had a star party near the end of their quarter. Unfortunately sky conditions weren\u0026#39;t great due to a bright moon and awful seeing. Even so, we tried to observe many objects with BOS and the AP 178 including Mars, Saturn, the Moon, a few binary stars and globular clusters, and tried for a few galaxies and nebulae even though most were washed out due to the Moon and the bad seeing. The group was great even given the not-so-ideal conditions, and one of the coolest things that the class was discussing on the way back from Sedgwick was the fact that they got a good demonstration of what \u0026ldquo;seeing\u0026rdquo; is, because they had only just heard about it. LCOGT attendees included Tim Brown, Rachel Street, and Rachel Ross\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESedgwick \u0026ndash; 6\/7:\u0026nbsp; A second physics class was able to make it up to Sedgwick for a star party, as well as having a tour of LCOGT two days earlier (with a few of the students staying a bit longer to watch the start of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/transitofvenus\u0022\u003Etransit of Venus\u003C\/a\u003E). This class had been using BOS in their class to get data for individual projects throughout the quarter. The sky was good, clear, and dark and we used BOS and an 11\u0026rdquo; Celestron (which was controlled by the students taking turns to get some hands-on experience) to view many objects including Mars, Saturn, several galaxies and globular clusters, a couple planetary nebulae and binary stars, as well as an open cluster at the very end of the night including learning some stars and constellations in between looking through the telescopes. BOS was being a bit finicky between each slew to a new object causing some delays but even so the night turned out to be quite successful and the group was great in asking a lot of questions and enjoying seeing objects through the telescope they had been previously been using robotically through a calender.

I\u0026rsquo;ve spent most of my adult life at university and have three degrees as a result - a combined undergraduate and masters degree in physics, another masters in high performance computing where I learned how to write code for supercomputers, and then my PhD in astronomy.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: So is the cluster we have here at LCOGT considered a supercomputer?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: It could be used in that way, but most of what we do with it is not really supercomputing. The difference is in the nature of the processes you run. For example, if you have a to-do list with five jobs on it, if you could ask five friends to each take one of the jobs, you could potentially get the list finished five times faster than if you did one task after another by yourself. The friends split up, and go and run their errands. That\u0026rsquo;s the kind of computing that tends to get done on the cluster. Astronomers will often have multiple instances of a program running on several different \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_processing_unit\u0022\u003ECPUs\u003C\/a\u003E, but each one is dealing with a different data set or set of initial conditions, and don\u0026rsquo;t need to communicate. This is called \u0026ldquo;trivial parallelism,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;task farming\u0026rdquo;.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EReal supercomputing is when the tasks can\u0026rsquo;t be done independently because they depend on one other. For example, when you\u0026rsquo;re modeling something like the weather, you might have a map of a certain area and divide it into a grid. You can run calculations on each square of the grid, but the edges of the grid squares influence each other (clouds don\u0026rsquo;t know about your grid!), so it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more complicated than task farming, because each process must communicate with others, running on other CPUs, all the time, to stay in sync and access the data they need.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe may eventually use the cluster to solve computationally-intensive aspects of the scheduling problem that would otherwise be intractable, but so far, that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been necessary.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What led you to the career or job you are doing now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: A great deal of luck! Although I have been interested in astronomy since I was young. We had a fascinating book lying around the house, \u0026ldquo;The Atlas of the Universe\u0026rdquo;, by Patrick Moore, which made a huge impression on me. Recently, on a trip back in England, I was looking at a piece of work from when I was seven years old. I had written a story about a boy flying to a globular cluster on a rocketship. So I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in astronomy for a long time...\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAt university, I decided to study physics after reading about \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Einstein\u0022\u003EEinstein\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feynman\u0022\u003EFeynman\u003C\/a\u003E, and digesting too many popular science books. In my final year I worked on data from a project that was modeling dark matter evolution with supercomputers, which was cool. Inspired by that, I was very lucky, and secured a scholarship to go to Edinburgh to study high performance computing. After that, I decided I wanted to do research in artificial intelligence at PhD level. While researching options, I found a PhD opening on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.estar.org.uk\/wiki\/index.php\/Main_Page\u0022\u003EeStar project\u003C\/a\u003E, which involved both \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_intelligence\u0022\u003EAI\u003C\/a\u003E and controlling robotic telescopes. My background in both physics and computing served me well, and I got the position.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETwo years into my PhD I gave a talk at a conference about my dissertation topic, which in a nutshell was about all the clever things one could achieve with networked robotic telescopes. I had prototyped some of my ideas, but a lot of it was theoretical at that time. However, a few people from LCOGT were in attendance, and afterwards they suggested I might be a good fit for LCOGT. And now here I am! I feel extremely lucky because my dissertation work was an incredibly niche topic, yet I have the opportunity to build on some of the ideas from my work, and make it happen. LCOGT\u0026rsquo;s network is a once-in-a-lifetime project, and it\u0026rsquo;s a real privilege to be able to make this stuff real.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: So what can the scheduler do now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: Right now it\u0026rsquo;s still in the prototype phase. One way to imagine it is like an onion, with a kernel at the core, and many layers wrapped around that. The various kinds of astronomical requests come in at the surface of the onion, are combined with what we understand about the state of the network, and then are translated and successively refined, until they can be expressed in the language of the scheduler, and reach the kernel. The kernel operates in an abstract mathematical space. It takes the requests, and decides how to arrange them to construct a solution. Then we translate back from our computer science problem into the real world, and use the solution to produce a real schedule, with observations to be placed at different telescopes.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThere are many different kinds of requests, from simple one-time observations to complex time-series requests, such as the observation of a target to be made five times, with three hours between each observation. The scheduler has to take into account when and from where each object is visible, where the observing conditions are met, and then figure out the best way to schedule the observations. In addition, each request has a priority given to it by the Time Allocation Committee (TAC), which influences our decisions. And all of this needs to be recalculated, often, because conditions are always changing, and things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected. In a way, you could say the job of the scheduler is to choose who loses, because somebody always will!\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: I spend some time keeping up on software team issues and discussions, often trying to clarify what we are doing. I also check in on the other projects I am involved in. When not in meetings, I spend the rest of the time writing and testing code, and lying on the floor thinking (a bad habit I picked up from my PhD supervisor, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.ex.ac.uk\/people\/timn\/\u0022\u003ETim Naylor\u003C\/a\u003E).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: Don\u0026rsquo;t go into it unless you find it fascinating because it\u0026rsquo;s really hard!

This is called \u201ctrivial parallelism,\u201d or \u201ctask farming\u201d.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EReal supercomputing is when the tasks can\u2019t be done independently because they depend on one other. For example, when you\u2019re modeling something like the weather, you might have a map of a certain area and divide it into a grid. You can run calculations on each square of the grid, but the edges of the grid squares influence each other (clouds don\u2019t know about your grid!), so it\u2019s a lot more complicated than task farming, because each process must communicate with others, running on other CPUs, all the time, to stay in sync and access the data they need.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe may eventually use the cluster to solve computationally-intensive aspects of the scheduling problem that would otherwise be intractable, but so far, that hasn\u2019t been necessary.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What led you to the career or job you are doing now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: A great deal of luck! Although I have been interested in astronomy since I was young. We had a fascinating book lying around the house, \u201cThe Atlas of the Universe\u201d, by Patrick Moore, which made a huge impression on me. Recently, on a trip back in England, I was looking at a piece of work from when I was seven years old. I had written a story about a boy flying to a globular cluster on a rocketship. So I guess I\u2019ve been interested in astronomy for a long time...\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAt university, I decided to study physics after reading about \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Einstein\u0022\u003EEinstein\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feynman\u0022\u003EFeynman\u003C\/a\u003E, and digesting too many popular science books. In my final year I worked on data from a project that was modeling dark matter evolution with supercomputers, which was cool. Inspired by that, I was very lucky, and secured a scholarship to go to Edinburgh to study high performance computing. After that, I decided I wanted to do research in artificial intelligence at PhD level. While researching options, I found a PhD opening on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.estar.org.uk\/wiki\/index.php\/Main_Page\u0022\u003EeStar project\u003C\/a\u003E, which involved both \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_intelligence\u0022\u003EAI\u003C\/a\u003E and controlling robotic telescopes. My background in both physics and computing served me well, and I got the position.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETwo years into my PhD I gave a talk at a conference about my dissertation topic, which in a nutshell was about all the clever things one could achieve with networked robotic telescopes. I had prototyped some of my ideas, but a lot of it was theoretical at that time. However, a few people from LCOGT were in attendance, and afterwards they suggested I might be a good fit for LCOGT. And now here I am! I feel extremely lucky because my dissertation work was an incredibly niche topic, yet I have the opportunity to build on some of the ideas from my work, and make it happen. LCOGT\u2019s network is a once-in-a-lifetime project, and it\u2019s a real privilege to be able to make this stuff real.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: So what can the scheduler do now?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: Right now it\u2019s still in the prototype phase. One way to imagine it is like an onion, with a kernel at the core, and many layers wrapped around that. The various kinds of astronomical requests come in at the surface of the onion, are combined with what we understand about the state of the network, and then are translated and successively refined, until they can be expressed in the language of the scheduler, and reach the kernel. The kernel operates in an abstract mathematical space. It takes the requests, and decides how to arrange them to construct a solution. Then we translate back from our computer science problem into the real world, and use the solution to produce a real schedule, with observations to be placed at different telescopes.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThere are many different kinds of requests, from simple one-time observations to complex time-series requests, such as the observation of a target to be made five times, with three hours between each observation. The scheduler has to take into account when and from where each object is visible, where the observing conditions are met, and then figure out the best way to schedule the observations. In addition, each request has a priority given to it by the Time Allocation Committee (TAC), which influences our decisions. And all of this needs to be recalculated, often, because conditions are always changing, and things don\u2019t go as expected. In a way, you could say the job of the scheduler is to choose who loses, because somebody always will!\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What is a typical day at work like?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: I spend some time keeping up on software team issues and discussions, often trying to clarify what we are doing. I also check in on the other projects I am involved in. When not in meetings, I spend the rest of the time writing and testing code, and lying on the floor thinking (a bad habit I picked up from my PhD supervisor, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.ex.ac.uk\/people\/timn\/\u0022\u003ETim Naylor\u003C\/a\u003E).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ci style=\u0022color: rgb(7, 55, 99);\u0022\u003EJB: What advice would you offer people wanting to go into the type of work you do?\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EES: Don\u2019t go into it unless you find it fascinating because it\u2019s really hard!

In astronomy there is often this temptation that bigger is better, and to keep building bigger and bigger telescopes. But with smaller telescopes you can automate and get more data with less effort. My PhD thesis was about roboticizing a 0.5 meter telescope, so this opportunity with LCOGT was a perfect fit for my interests in robotic telescopes, exoplanets, and building instruments.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \u0022\u003EJB: So what do you think of the news about the Higgs boson?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EJE: I was actually a bit disappointed. I had been hoping that something was going to be discovered that would show clearly that the standard model is wrong and that we would have to rethink everything. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been all that satisfied with the the need for dark matter and dark energy. It seems like we just really don\u0026rsquo;t understand gravity very well.

In astronomy there is often this temptation that bigger is better, and to keep building bigger and bigger telescopes. But with smaller telescopes you can automate and get more data with less effort. My PhD thesis was about roboticizing a 0.5 meter telescope, so this opportunity with LCOGT was a perfect fit for my interests in robotic telescopes, exoplanets, and building instruments.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(7, 55, 99); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; \u0022\u003EJB: So what do you think of the news about the Higgs boson?\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EJE: I was actually a bit disappointed.

I\u2019ve never been all that satisfied with the the need for dark matter and dark energy. It seems like we just really don\u2019t understand gravity very well.

Thus they were observing a supernova overtaking a prior nova event.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrevious observational studies suggested that many or most Type Ia supernovae originated from the merger of two white dwarf stars. \u00a0But in\u00a0this case, a white dwarf exploded because the white dwarf increased its mass by stealing matter from a red giant star in orbit around it. \u00a0As the white dwarf grew in mass it experienced a series of smaller explosions (novae) that left the white dwarf intact. \u00a0This was the first observational evidence that in fact a recurrent nova, could lead to the ultimate destruction of the star as a supernova.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional links:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnline version of the Times article, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/28\/science\/space\/white-dwarf-can-pair-with-red-giant-for-supernova.html?_r=1\u0022\u003EMore Than One Kind of Partner for a Supernova\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOriginal University of California Santa Barbara release, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.ia.ucsb.edu\/pa\/display.aspx?pkey=2810\u0022\u003ENew Findings Show Some Type Ia Supernovae Linked to Nova\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFull paper in Science, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/337\/6097\/942\u0022\u003EPTF 11kx: A Type Ia Supernova with a Symbiotic Nova Progenitor\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E",

Also in the mix of activities were the popular Seeing through Alien Eyes (adapted from the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/astrosociety.org\/\u0022\u003EAstronomical Society of the Pacific\u003C\/a\u003E, where filtered glasses are used to see how our eyes may see color if we were from a planet with a different type of sun, as well as a demonstration of why astronomers use filters in their observations) and hunting for asteroids using \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/observations\/\u0022\u003Edata\u003C\/a\u003E from LCOGT\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/lcogt.net\/network\/2m\u0022\u003E2-meter\u003C\/a\u003E telescopes.

Please note that only queue-scheduled observations can be made through a background proposal, and no guarantees can be made as to its execution. Nevertheless, background proposals should clearly state the amount of time requested.

If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EQueue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)\u003C\/h3\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThese observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EQueue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are\u003Cbr \/\u003Eattempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality.

Please note that only queue-scheduled observations can be made through a background proposal, and no guarantees can be made as to its execution. Nevertheless, background proposals should clearly state the amount of time requested.

This was the first school I visited, giving a talk mostly about astronomy but also a very brief introduction to LCOGT and some of our programmes, particularly \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/portal.lcogt.net\/agentexoplanet\u0022\u003EAgent Exoplanet\u003C\/a\u003E. I was talking to the \u0026#39;honours\u0026#39; group who are students who elect to take extra lessons which broaden their academic knowledge into areas they are not studying for A-level, like astronomy. These extra lessons are to prepare the students for the ordeals ahead of them when they apply into Oxford, Cambridge and Russell Group universities.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI gave them an hour long talk, which they then asked 20 minutes of questions afterwards, which hopefully is a measure of how interested they were. I very much hope this will inspire them to be more involved in using our telescopes in the future.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThat evening \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk\/contactsandpeople\/?page=full\u0026amp;id=151\u0022\u003EHaley Gomez\u003C\/a\u003E, Hugh Lang and I hosted tours of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk\/teachingandlearning\/observatory\/\u0022\u003ECardiff University observatory\u003C\/a\u003E (which houses a 50cm Newtonian telescope) to over 60 members of the public. Sadly the weather did not cooperate, as is often the case in Wales, but this did not seem to hamper the enthusiasm of the visitors who asked searching astronomy questions to all of us. We managed to give the visitors the odd glimpse of the Moon through gaps in the cloud, using a couple of the University\u0026#39;s 4\u0026quot; reflecting telescopes. When the sky was very cloudy we satisfied them by observing a local welsh castle, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/cadw.wales.gov.uk\/daysout\/castell-coch\/?lang=en\u0022\u003ECastell Coch\u003C\/a\u003E instead.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELater that week, I visited \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/trelaiprm.cardiff.sch.uk\/\u0022\u003ETrelai Primary School\u003C\/a\u003E and spent the morning running an astronomy workshop with the whole of year 2 (56 children aged 6\/7). As with all primary schools talks and workshops I give, I used a mixture of \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/unawe.org\u0022\u003EUniverse Awareness\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022\/education\u0022\u003ELCOGT activities\u003C\/a\u003E. I was fortunate enough to have been given a prototype \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.unawe.org\/resources\/universebox\/\u0022\u003EUniverse in a Box\u003C\/a\u003E kit which Universe Awareness is in the process of developing. From that kit we investigated the scale of Earth and the Moon, where the phases of the Moon come from and why we always see the same face of the Moon (which involves making masks using pictures of the Moon).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ENext we explored telescopes. I talked them through some pictures of telescopes, explaining why there are so many different styles of telescope, why we need them and what types of thing you can see with each of them. We followed that up with some robotic telescope role-playing, involving all the children in the main school hall. 3 children played the part of the telescope (one to operate the digital camera, and one each for the azimuth and altitude axes); a couple of children held models of planets and spread out in different parts of the hall; the rest of the children made the internet by forming a chain-gang between the telescope and the astronomer (me). I sent a request to the \u0026#39;telescope\u0026#39; by writing the name of one of the planets and passing it down the \u0026#39;internet\u0026#39;. The telescope was parked (i.e. pointing straight up) so the children moved into position pointing at the required planet and took a picture. The SD card from the camera was then passed back down the chain gang to the astronomer and the picture printed on a little photo printer. We repeated this a couple of times.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe finished the day by drawing fantasy telescopes (which involved a broad mixture of space ships and traditional tripod base telescopes). The best 4 received a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.unawe.org\/resources\/guides\/EU-UNAWE_cosmos_pocket_activity\/\u0022\u003ECosmos in your Pocket\u003C\/a\u003E activity book as a prize. Finally we did a little show and tell with the 4\u0026quot; refracting telescope I had taken along.

This was the first school I visited, giving a talk mostly about astronomy but also a very brief introduction to LCOGT and some of our programmes, particularly \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/portal.lcogt.net\/agentexoplanet\u0022\u003EAgent Exoplanet\u003C\/a\u003E. I was talking to the \u0027honours\u0027 group who are students who elect to take extra lessons which broaden their academic knowledge into areas they are not studying for A-level, like astronomy. These extra lessons are to prepare the students for the ordeals ahead of them when they apply into Oxford, Cambridge and Russell Group universities.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI gave them an hour long talk, which they then asked 20 minutes of questions afterwards, which hopefully is a measure of how interested they were. I very much hope this will inspire them to be more involved in using our telescopes in the future.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThat evening \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk\/contactsandpeople\/?page=full\u0026amp;id=151\u0022\u003EHaley Gomez\u003C\/a\u003E, Hugh Lang and I hosted tours of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.astro.cardiff.ac.uk\/teachingandlearning\/observatory\/\u0022\u003ECardiff University observatory\u003C\/a\u003E (which houses a 50cm Newtonian telescope) to over 60 members of the public. Sadly the weather did not cooperate, as is often the case in Wales, but this did not seem to hamper the enthusiasm of the visitors who asked searching astronomy questions to all of us. We managed to give the visitors the odd glimpse of the Moon through gaps in the cloud, using a couple of the University\u0027s 4\u0022 reflecting telescopes. When the sky was very cloudy we satisfied them by observing a local welsh castle, \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/cadw.wales.gov.uk\/daysout\/castell-coch\/?lang=en\u0022\u003ECastell Coch\u003C\/a\u003E instead.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELater that week, I visited \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/trelaiprm.cardiff.sch.uk\/\u0022\u003ETrelai Primary School\u003C\/a\u003E and spent the morning running an astronomy workshop with the whole of year 2 (56 children aged 6\/7). As with all primary schools talks and workshops I give, I used a mixture of \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/unawe.org\u0022\u003EUniverse Awareness\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022\/education\u0022\u003ELCOGT activities\u003C\/a\u003E. I was fortunate enough to have been given a prototype \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.unawe.org\/resources\/universebox\/\u0022\u003EUniverse in a Box\u003C\/a\u003E kit which Universe Awareness is in the process of developing. From that kit we investigated the scale of Earth and the Moon, where the phases of the Moon come from and why we always see the same face of the Moon (which involves making masks using pictures of the Moon).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ENext we explored telescopes. I talked them through some pictures of telescopes, explaining why there are so many different styles of telescope, why we need them and what types of thing you can see with each of them. We followed that up with some robotic telescope role-playing, involving all the children in the main school hall. 3 children played the part of the telescope (one to operate the digital camera, and one each for the azimuth and altitude axes); a couple of children held models of planets and spread out in different parts of the hall; the rest of the children made the internet by forming a chain-gang between the telescope and the astronomer (me). I sent a request to the \u0027telescope\u0027 by writing the name of one of the planets and passing it down the \u0027internet\u0027. The telescope was parked (i.e. pointing straight up) so the children moved into position pointing at the required planet and took a picture. The SD card from the camera was then passed back down the chain gang to the astronomer and the picture printed on a little photo printer. We repeated this a couple of times.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe finished the day by drawing fantasy telescopes (which involved a broad mixture of space ships and traditional tripod base telescopes). The best 4 received a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.unawe.org\/resources\/guides\/EU-UNAWE_cosmos_pocket_activity\/\u0022\u003ECosmos in your Pocket\u003C\/a\u003E activity book as a prize. Finally we did a little show and tell with the 4\u0022 refracting telescope I had taken along.

Hjelstrom also used Tekola as a full member of the team. Abiy helped build all three telescopes, install the mirrors and instrument packages, and worked on the painstaking wiring and testing of the telescopes. After the first of the three telescopes was reconstructed, the team started working nights as well as days to begin collimating and aligning the telescopes. Tekola ascended the mountain to participate in these night shifts also. By the third night, he was working out how to use the telescopes to make his own observations.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe came by his science, and his role at LCOGT, through a circuitous path.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEthiopian Emissary\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbiy was fascinated by astronomy at a young age.

Debrezeit, a small city of roughly 100,000, is home to an air force base, and has good schools. But, Abiy recalls that repeated searches of the school library turned up no astronomy books.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot until Abiy attended Alemaya (now Haramaya) University did his physics professor, Girma Gonfa, lend him a 1970s astronomy text. \u0026ldquo;I read that book cover-to-cover several times,\u0026rdquo; Abiy recalled. \u0026ldquo;Then I lent it to my friends and they all read it.\u0026rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe book was terribly outdated, but it gave him a basis, and further piqued his curiosity. \u0026ldquo;I heard about black holes for the first time that year. It was mind-blowing.\u0026rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that point on, Abiy shifted his focus to astronomy. He received a BS in Physics from Alemaya and accepted a year-long graduate assistant in physics position with Mekelle University. Following this, he was accepted at Addis Abada University for the Masters in Science program in Theoretical Cosmology and Astrophysics. But before he could even get started there, Abiy met professor Legesse Kebede, who introduced him to the newly-formed National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP - \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.star.ac.za\/\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.star.ac.za\/\u003C\/a\u003E) based in South Africa.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initiative, centered at the University of Cape Town (UCT), offers masters and doctoral programs in both astrophysics and in space and scientific engineering. The intent is to develop the technical talent needed to bring South Africa\u0026rsquo;s investment in astronomy to fruition. In addition to an intensive curriculum at UCT, students spent time in the field at the SAAO site at Sutherland where the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is located, the radio telescope facility at Hartebeesthoek, and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS). Recruiting efforts for the program were spread across the entire African continent.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbiy applied immediately, was accepted, and left to join 16 other students in the program in 2005. Abiy had traversed Ethiopia, but this was his first venture outside his home country. The following year, Abiy participated in an exchange program with Vanderbilt University\u0026rsquo;s Astrophysics Department, in Nashville, Tennessee. These experiences outside Ethiopia were revelatory.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026ldquo;Ethiopia is different than most other African countries,\u0026rdquo; he explained. \u0026ldquo;It is a more closed and homogenous society than most other African countries partly because it was never colonized.\u0026rdquo; Encountering people from other African countries, and then from the United States and elsewhere in the world, Abiy found he had to become more gregarious and develop social skills.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutreach was a component of Abiy\u0026rsquo;s MSc program that he enjoyed. He was finally able to answer in some detail what keeps the stars hanging there. He worked with Kevin Govender who was the head of Education at SAAO at the time. It was from Govender that he learned of the open joint LCOGT-SAAO postdoc position of which outreach was an important element.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026quot;I applied for the position and the interview was set up two days before my thesis was due.

Following the lead of UNESCO and the IAU, several African countries have invested in astronomy programs at the state-run universities, and as a result are in the process of building their own observational capabilities.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESouth Africa has a long history in the annals of astronomy. The first observatory there was commissioned in 1820 and was used as a navigational center for the British navy. The program expanded into astronomical research starting in the 1930s and spread to observatories in Pretoria and Johannesburg.

In the last six months, Tekola, who holds a Ph.D. in observational astronomy, has turned a wrench and manned a hoist, among other tasks, in the installation of three robotic telescopes and the underlying IT and electrical systems.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETekola, based at the SAAO headquarters in Cape Town, has supported two separate teams from LCOGT during installation visits to the SAAO site outside Sutherland. The first team, arriving in September of last year, installed electrical and computer systems for three domes.

Abiy helped build all three telescopes, install the mirrors and instrument packages, and worked on the painstaking wiring and testing of the telescopes. After the first of the three telescopes was reconstructed, the team started working nights as well as days to begin collimating and aligning the telescopes. Tekola ascended the mountain to participate in these night shifts also. By the third night, he was working out how to use the telescopes to make his own observations.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe came by his science, and his role at LCOGT, through a circuitous path.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEthiopian Emissary\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbiy was fascinated by astronomy at a young age.

Debrezeit, a small city of roughly 100,000, is home to an air force base, and has good schools. But, Abiy recalls that repeated searches of the school library turned up no astronomy books.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot until Abiy attended Alemaya (now Haramaya) University did his physics professor, Girma Gonfa, lend him a 1970s astronomy text. \u201cI read that book cover-to-cover several times,\u201d Abiy recalled. \u201cThen I lent it to my friends and they all read it.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe book was terribly outdated, but it gave him a basis, and further piqued his curiosity. \u201cI heard about black holes for the first time that year. It was mind-blowing.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that point on, Abiy shifted his focus to astronomy. He received a BS in Physics from Alemaya and accepted a year-long graduate assistant in physics position with Mekelle University. Following this, he was accepted at Addis Abada University for the Masters in Science program in Theoretical Cosmology and Astrophysics. But before he could even get started there, Abiy met professor Legesse Kebede, who introduced him to the newly-formed National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP - \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.star.ac.za\/\u0022\u003Ehttp:\/\/www.star.ac.za\/\u003C\/a\u003E) based in South Africa.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initiative, centered at the University of Cape Town (UCT), offers masters and doctoral programs in both astrophysics and in space and scientific engineering. The intent is to develop the technical talent needed to bring South Africa\u2019s investment in astronomy to fruition. In addition to an intensive curriculum at UCT, students spent time in the field at the SAAO site at Sutherland where the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is located, the radio telescope facility at Hartebeesthoek, and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS). Recruiting efforts for the program were spread across the entire African continent.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbiy applied immediately, was accepted, and left to join 16 other students in the program in 2005. Abiy had traversed Ethiopia, but this was his first venture outside his home country. The following year, Abiy participated in an exchange program with Vanderbilt University\u2019s Astrophysics Department, in Nashville, Tennessee. These experiences outside Ethiopia were revelatory.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u201cEthiopia is different than most other African countries,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is a more closed and homogenous society than most other African countries partly because it was never colonized.\u201d Encountering people from other African countries, and then from the United States and elsewhere in the world, Abiy found he had to become more gregarious and develop social skills.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutreach was a component of Abiy\u2019s MSc program that he enjoyed. He was finally able to answer in some detail what keeps the stars hanging there. He worked with Kevin Govender who was the head of Education at SAAO at the time. It was from Govender that he learned of the open joint LCOGT-SAAO postdoc position of which outreach was an important element.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I applied for the position and the interview was set up two days before my thesis was due.

Dr. Chow also specializes in the research of treatments for degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and has spearheaded multi-university research in this area. He is the inventor of the Artificial Silicon Retina, and the founder of Optobionics, which has returned a level of vision to blinded patients.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.15;\u0022\u003EBut Dr. Chow is also a long-time avid astronomer who launched a project to build his own telescope over thirty years ago.

However, we also offer background-priority ranking, which can be selected on the proposal form. Background programs are intended to fill gaps in the schedule when no other program can be done, by providing reservoir of observations which can be executed at any time and (ideally) in any conditions. Please note that only queue-scheduled observations can be made through a background proposal, and no guarantees can be made as to its execution. Nevertheless, background proposals should clearly state the amount of time requested.

If blocks are released, the corresponding program will not be charged for the time. After that point, all requested blocks are treated as scheduled blocks and will be charged accordingly.\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis policy is in place to prevent users from gaming the system,whereby many blocks may be scheduled in advance and then released before the observations are made in order, for example, to avoid predicted bad weather conditions or to flood the schedule early on to prevent competitors from scheduling observations at times which might later be deemed valuable.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EQueue-scheduled Observations (inc. those for Background Proposals)\u003C\/h3\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThese observations are charged by adding open-shutter time, instrument cycle time (including readout and other dead time), and a flat fee for other.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EQueue-scheduled observations are charged if the observations are\u003Cbr \/\u003Eattempted and data are delivered, regardless of data quality.

However, we also offer background-priority ranking, which can be selected on the proposal form. Background programs are intended to fill gaps in the schedule when no other program can be done, by providing reservoir of observations which can be executed at any time and (ideally) in any conditions. Please note that only queue-scheduled observations can be made through a background proposal, and no guarantees can be made as to its execution. Nevertheless, background proposals should clearly state the amount of time requested. All other proposals should go through the standard TAC-ranked channel.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo those connected with programs to which we already have made major commitments (e.g. the schools programs, U.

Key projects are large, coherent observing programs designed to take maximum advantage of the unique attributes of the LCOGT network to address important astrophysical problems. Our goal is to highlight for the world the best science that can be done with the LCOGT network. It is anticipated that key projects will have a minimum duration of one year and a maximum of three years. We expect to issue a call for new key project to start each year, and so it is unlikely that the entire pool of key project time will be allocated in this first year. We expect to approve two or three key projects to start this year. Time not allocated for key projects will be available for standard proposals, for which a call will be issued near the end of January 2014. The expected 1-year total of time available for key projects through this call is approximately 6000 hours of 1-meter time and 1200 hours of 2-meter time.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis call is the first announcement of time available for V1.0 of the LCOGT network. This means that a limited complement of capabilities will be available and fully supported. At this time, we believe that this will include the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/observatory\/instruments\/sinistro\u0022\u003ESinistro\u003C\/a\u003E cameras on all \u003Ca href=\u0022\/observatory\/1m\u0022\u003E1-meter\u003C\/a\u003E telescopes and the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/observatory\/instruments\/floyds\u0022\u003EFLOYDS spectrographs\u003C\/a\u003E on the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/observatory\/2m\u0022\u003E2-meter telescopes\u003C\/a\u003E. More details of the V1.0 capabilities are listed below. At this time, we anticipate that V1.0 observations will begin on April 1, 2014, but the start of the semes ter will be delayed if critical aspects of the system are not ready.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey projects will be large efforts \u0026ndash; involving several thousand hours of observation. We expect that project teams will form to carry these out. The level of effort will be significant but the potential return is great. Because LCOGT is contributing large amounts of telescope time to support this program, we require that collaborators on proposing teams coming from other institutions commit significant resources to the effort. Such resources could be access to other facilities, or additional time on the LCOGT network from their own institution, or computing resources, or scientist time.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe invite all LCOGT collaborators to submit proposals to the LCOGT Key Project Program. This includes the LCOGT site partners (ANU, AURA \u0026ndash; on behalf of the Chilean astronomical community, SAAO, IfA, and University of Texas) , including those sites (IAC and XAO) at which telescopes are planned but not yet built. It also includes the institutions with whi ch we have other types of partnerships \u0026ndash; IPAC, University of Colorado , University of California at Santa Barbara, and St. Andrews University. Anyone who lists one of these institutions as their affiliation for published research may PI a proposal. We also invite the LCOGT extended scientific family \u0026ndash; in addition to current staff, this includes astronomers who were postdocs at LCOGT within the last 5 years, and astronomers who contributed to our advisory and allocation committees within the last 2 years .\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to manage this process effectively, we require that anyone who intends to submit a key project proposal submit a letter of intent by December 1, 2013. Letters of intent will allow us to identify potential collaborators and to ensure appropriate e xpertise on the TAC.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EGeneral Information on Time Allocation\u003C\/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA number of studies have shown that key projects provide the maximum scientific impact of a new facility, especially one that opens up a new area of parameter space. It had been the hope of LCOGT scientific management that the institutions that form the science collaboration would agree that jointly funding a key project program would result in a benefit to all the institutions in a way that transcended the amount of telescope time that they we re guaranteed.

Key projects are large, coherent observing programs designed to take maximum advantage of the unique attributes of the LCOGT network to address important astrophysical problems. Our goal is to highlight for the world the best science that can be done with the LCOGT network. It is anticipated that key projects will have a minimum duration of one year and a maximum of three years. We expect to issue a call for new key project to start each year, and so it is unlikely that the entire pool of key project time will be allocated in this first year. We expect to approve two or three key projects to start this year. Time not allocated for key projects will be available for standard proposals, for which a call will be issued near the end of January 2014. The expected 1-year total of time available for key projects through this call is approximately 6000 hours of 1-meter time and 1200 hours of 2-meter time.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis call is the first announcement of time available for V1.0 of the LCOGT network. This means that a limited complement of capabilities will be available and fully supported.

More details of the V1.0 capabilities are listed below. At this time, we anticipate that V1.0 observations will begin on April 1, 2014, but the start of the semes ter will be delayed if critical aspects of the system are not ready.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey projects will be large efforts \u2013 involving several thousand hours of observation. We expect that project teams will form to carry these out. The level of effort will be significant but the potential return is great. Because LCOGT is contributing large amounts of telescope time to support this program, we require that collaborators on proposing teams coming from other institutions commit significant resources to the effort. Such resources could be access to other facilities, or additional time on the LCOGT network from their own institution, or computing resources, or scientist time.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe invite all LCOGT collaborators to submit proposals to the LCOGT Key Project Program. This includes the LCOGT site partners (ANU, AURA \u2013 on behalf of the Chilean astronomical community, SAAO, IfA, and University of Texas) , including those sites (IAC and XAO) at which telescopes are planned but not yet built. It also includes the institutions with whi ch we have other types of partnerships \u2013 IPAC, University of Colorado , University of California at Santa Barbara, and St. Andrews University. Anyone who lists one of these institutions as their affiliation for published research may PI a proposal. We also invite the LCOGT extended scientific family \u2013 in addition to current staff, this includes astronomers who were postdocs at LCOGT within the last 5 years, and astronomers who contributed to our advisory and allocation committees within the last 2 years .\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to manage this process effectively, we require that anyone who intends to submit a key project proposal submit a letter of intent by December 1, 2013.

Ultimately, trying to work out the details of this arrangement became too difficult and complicated, and we fell back to the current position. Each partner institution can use their guaranteed time as they wish.

A new section of our website will provide information needed by proposers and users of our network. Although development, deployment, and commissioning are still ongoing, we expect that V1.0 will look like this:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWe will have four sites with operating \u003Ca href=\u0022\/observatory\/1m\u0022\u003E1-meter telescopes\u003C\/a\u003E \u2013 Australia, Chile, South Africa (a complete southern ring), and Texas.

We will continue to operate the imagers on the 2-meters, but they are not guaranteed to be fully supported yet.
